**Comparison between algebraic & differential geometry**: while both fields study "shapes" defined by equations, their central motivations differ based on the tools available (calculus vs. algebra).
- **Differential geometry (DG)**: the central problem is often **Classification under Curvature and Metric.** DG asks: "How does the local measurement of distance and angles (the metric) constrain the global shape (the topology)?" It is fundamentally driven by analysis and differential equations.
- **Algebraic geometry (AG)**: the central problem is **Classification of Solution Sets of Polynomials.** AG asks: "How do the algebraic properties of a ring of functions determine the geometric singularities and intersections of its variety?" It is driven by the rigidity of polynomials.

Given algebraically closed [[Field]] $k$ and the [[Polynomial Ring]] $R = k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, an **affine algebraic set** is the zero-locus of a system of polynomials equations on the [[Affine Space]] $\mathbb A_k^n=k^n$:$$V(S)=\set{p\in\mathbb A_k^n:f(p)=0,\forall f\in S}\where S\subset R$$An **affine (algebraic) variety** is a affine algebraic set that is **irreducible**, i.e., is not the union of two proper affine algebraic subsets.      
- **Arithmetic properties**
	- **Affine variety of generated ideal**: we have $V(S)=V((S)),\forall S\subset R$, which can be verified directly via two-sided inclusion. 
	- **Union & intersection**: given any two ideals $I,J\in\mathcal I(R)$ we have $$\begin{align}V(I)\cup V(J)&=V(IJ)=V(I\cap J)\\V(I)\cap V(J)&=V(I+J)=V(I\cup J)\end{align}$$which can be verified easily. As a generalization, we have $$V\left(\bigcup_{\alpha}I_\alpha\right)=\bigcap_{\alpha}V(I_\alpha),\quad V\left(\bigcap_{\alpha}I_\alpha\right)=\bigcup_{\alpha}V(I_\alpha)$$given any collection of ideals $\set{I_\alpha}_\alpha\subset\mathcal I(R)$. 
	- **Ideal-variety correspondence**: by union & intersection property we can deduce $$I \subset J \imply V(J) \subset V(I)$$as the containment-reversing correspondence between $I$ and $V(I)$. 
- **Ideal of a subset**: given $X\subset\mathbb A_k^n$ we define $$I(X)=\set{f\in R:f(p)=0,\forall p\in X}$$which is a **radical** [[Ideal]] by definition. 
	- **Dual inclusion**: we can easily verify that $$X\subset Y\imply I(Y)\subset I(X)$$Moreover, $I(\varnothing)=(1),I(\mathbb A_k^n)=(0)$. 
	- **Affine coordinate ring**: the affine coordinate ring of $X\subset\mathbb A_k^n$ is defined as $$A(X)=R/I(X)$$This ring acts as functions on $X$ just as the elements of $R$ acts as functions on $\mathbb A_k^n$, and we take quotient w.r.t $I(X)$ mainly to ensure that any two elements are **distinct** on $X$. 
- **Noetherian Property**: since $k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ is Noetherian by Hilbert basis theorem ([[Polynomial Ring]]), every algebraic set is defined by a **finite** number of polynomials.
- **Dimension**: The dimension of $X$ is defined as the Krull dimension of its coordinate ring $A(X)$ (the length of the longest chain of prime ideals). This matches the intuitive geometric dimension.
- **Function Duality**: Every geometric property of $X$ is encoded in the algebraic properties of $A(X)$. For instance, $X$ is a point if and only if $A(X) \cong k$. 
## Hilbert's Nullstellensatz
**Hilbert's Nullstellensatz**: given $I\in\mathcal I(R)$ we have $$I(V(I)))=\sqrt I$$**Proof**: 
- Part B (The Rabinowitsch Trick): Suppose $g \in I(V(J))$, meaning $g$ vanishes whenever all $f_i$ vanish. We want to show $g^N \in J$ for some $N$. Consider the polynomial ring with one extra variable: $k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y]$. Define a new ideal: $$J^* = \langle f_1, \dots, f_m, 1 - y \cdot g(x_1, \dots, x_n) \rangle \subseteq k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y]$$Show that the variety $V(J^*) \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{n+1}$ is empty.
- Part C (The Culmination): Apply the Weak Nullstellensatz to $J^*$ to conclude that $1 \in J^*$. This implies there exist polynomials $h_i, p \in k[x_1, \dots, x_n, y]$ such that: $$1 = \sum_{i=1}^m h_i(x, y) f_i(x) + p(x, y)(1 - yg(x))$$By substituting $y = 1/g(x)$ into this identity (working in the fraction field $k(x_1, \dots, x_n)$) and clearing denominators, prove that $g^N \in J$ for some $N$.
- **Intuition**: the result itself is actually quite trivial, since polynomials vanishing on a set over which a given set of polynomials vanishes are expected to be radicals of the latter ideal. Note that we can only hope to recover the radical rather than the ideal itself because when the generator of the ideal is reducible, all its factors must also be taken in, e.g., $$I(V((z^2)))=(z)$$on the affine space $\mathbb C$. 
## Regular map
Given $X\subset\mathbb A_k^n,Y\subset\mathbb A_k^m$ two affine varieties, a map $\phi:X\to Y$ is **regular** if $$\phi(p)=(f_1(p),\cdots,f_m(p)),\quad\forall p\in X\where f_1,\cdots,f_m\in k[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$$This is a algebraic version of regular (smooth) maps between [[Smooth Manifold]]. 
- **Coordinate ring morphism**: $\phi:X\to Y$ is regular iff its pullback $$\phi^*:A(Y)\to A(X),\quad g\mapsto g\circ\phi$$is a well-defined $k$-algebra ([[Field]]) homomorphism. 
- **Regularity at a point**: a function $f: X \to k$ is regular at $p \in X$ if there exists an open neighborhood $U \subset X$ of $p$ such that $f = g/h$ where $g, h \in A(X)$ and $h \neq 0$ on $U$. For affine varieties, a function that is regular at every point is simply an element of $A(X)$.
- **Biregular map (isomorphism)**: a regular map $\phi: X \to Y$ is biregular if there exists a regular map $\psi: Y \to X$ such that $\psi \circ \phi = \text{id}_X$ and $\phi \circ \psi = \text{id}_Y$. This is equivalent to $A(X) \cong A(Y)$.
- **Continuity**: Every regular map is continuous with respect to the Zariski topology, though the converse is far from true.
### Rational map
A **rational map** $\phi: X \dashrightarrow Y$ is an equivalence class of pairs $(U, \phi_U)$, where $U \subset X$ is a Zariski open set ([[Affine Space]]) and $\phi_U: U \to Y$ is a regular map. Two pairs $(U, \phi_U)$ and $(V, \phi_V)$ are equivalent if they agree on $U \cap V$.
- **Intuition**: rational maps generalize regular maps by allowing the function to be undefined on a "small" set (a lower-dimensional subvariety).
- **Domain of definition**: the largest open set $U$ on which a representative of $\phi$ is defined is called the domain of $\phi$. The complement $X \setminus U$ is the **locus of indeterminacy**.
- **Dominant map**: rational $\phi: X \dashrightarrow Y$ is dominant if $\phi(U)$ is dense in $Y$. This is a crucial condition because only dominant rational maps induce a field inclusion of function fields: $\phi^*: K(Y) \hookrightarrow K(X)$.
- **Birational map**: a dominant rational map is birational if it has a rational inverse. Two varieties admitting a birational map between them are said to be **birationally equivalent**. 
    - This is a much weaker equivalence than biregularity. It means the varieties are "the same" except for possibly some "bad" lower-dimensional behavior.
### Example
To illustrate the difference between biregular and birational, consider the **cuspidal cubic** $C = V(y^2 - x^3) \subset \mathbb{A}^2$.
- **Normalization map (birational but not biregular)**: consider the map $$\pi: \mathbb{A}^1 \to C,\quad t \mapsto (t^2, t^3)$$This is clearly a regular map defined by polynomials, and we can define a rational inverse $$\psi: C \dashrightarrow \mathbb{A}^1,\quad \psi(x, y) = y/x$$However the map $\psi$ is not regular at the origin $(0,0)$ because the ratio $y/x$ becomes $0/0$. Therefore $C$ and $\mathbb{A}^1$ are **birational**. Their function fields are both isomorphic to $k(t)$. However, they are **not biregular** (isomorphic) because the coordinate ring $A(C) = k[x,y]/(y^2-x^3)$ is not a Unique Factorization Domain, whereas $A(\mathbb{A}^1) = k[t]$ is.
- **Stereographic projection (rational map)**: consider the unit circle $S = V(x^2 + y^2 - 1) \subset \mathbb{A}^2$. The map projecting from the "North Pole" $N=(0,1)$ defined by $$\phi: S \dashrightarrow \mathbb{A}^1,\quad\phi(x,y) = \frac{x}{1-y}$$is rational, and is further dominant and has a rational inverse, making the circle **rational** (birational to a line). This explains why we can parameterize Pythagorean triples: the rational points on the circle correspond to the rational points on the line.
## Function field
Given $X\subset\mathbb A_k^n$ we defined the **function field** via the field of fraction ([[Integral Domain]]) $$K(X)=\Frac A(X)$$Geometrically, any element $f/g\in K(X)$ is defined on the principal open set $D(g)$, which is dense in $X$. 
- **Identification of variety via function field**: two varieties are birationally equivalent iff their function fields are isomorphic.  
- **Extensions as Projections**: If we have a finite extension of fields $L/K$, we can view this as a map of varieties $Y \to X$. The degree of the extension $[L:K]$ tells us how many points of $Y$ typically lie over a single point of $X$.
- **Galois Groups as Symmetries**: If $L/K$ is a Galois extension, the Galois group $\text{Gal}(L/K)$ acts as the group of "deck transformations." These are the algebraic symmetries that permute the points in the fibers of the map $Y \to X$ without changing the underlying "base" point in $X$.
### Example: the square root map
Take $k=\mathbb C,X=\mathbb A_{\mathbb C}^1$. The coordinate ring and function field is given by $$A(X)=\mathbb C[x],\quad K=K(X)=\mathbb C(x)$$Now consider the extension given by adjoining the square root of $x$: $$L=\mathbb C(x)[y]/(y^2-x)\cong\mathbb C(y)$$Then we have $[L:K]=2$, and the Galois group is $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, with the non-trivial automorphism $\sigma: y \mapsto -y$.
- **Geometric realization**: this field extension corresponds to the variety $$Y=V(y^2-x)\subset\mathbb A_{\mathbb C}^2$$which is parabola. The correspondence between inclusion and projection is given by $$K\hookrightarrow L\quad\longleftrightarrow\quad\pi:Y\to X,\quad (x,y)\mapsto x$$For any point $x = a$ (where $a \neq 0$), there are exactly two pre-images: $(a, \sqrt{a})$ and $(a, -\sqrt{a})$. This "2-to-1" nature is the geometric manifestation of the field extension being of **degree 2**.
