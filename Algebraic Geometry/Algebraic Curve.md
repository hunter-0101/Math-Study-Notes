An **affine algebraic curve** is an [[Affine Variety]] $C$ with the dimension condition $$\dim A(C)=1$$
- **Polynomial Definition**: In $\mathbb{A}_k^2$, a curve is typically defined by the zero-locus of a single non-constant irreducible polynomial $f(x, y) \in k[x, y]$.
- **Coordinate Ring**: The ring $A(C) = k[x_1, \dots, x_n] / I(C)$ is an integral domain of dimension 1.
- **Function Field**: The field of rational functions $k(C)$ (the fraction field of $A(C)$) has a transcendence degree of 1 over $k$.
- **Genericity**: Any non-empty Zariski-open subset of a curve is dense and contains all but finitely many points of the curve.
## Properties
- **Ideal-Variety Correspondence**: For a curve $C = V(I)$, the ideal $I(C)$ is a prime ideal because $C$ is irreducible. By the Nullstellensatz, $I(V(J)) = \sqrt{J}$, so if $J$ is the ideal generated by the defining polynomials of a curve, $I(C)$ is its radical.
    
- **Zariski Topology**: The closed sets of a curve $C$ (other than $C$ itself and $\varnothing$) are exactly the finite sets of points. This makes the Zariski topology on a curve the cofinite topology.
    
- **Noetherian Property**: Since the ambient polynomial ring is Noetherian, the ideal of any curve $I(C)$ is finitely generated. Even if a curve in $\mathbb{A}^3$ is the intersection of many surfaces, a finite number of equations suffices to define it.
    
- **Dimension and Points**: A point $p \in C$ corresponds to a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_p \subset A(C)$. The fact that $\dim(A(C)) = 1$ means there are no prime ideals "between" the zero ideal (representing the curve itself) and the maximal ideals (representing points).
## Example
### Twisted cubic
Let the underlying affine space be $\mathbb A_{\mathbb C}^3$, and consider the **twisted cubic** $$C=\set{(t,t^2,t^3):t\in\mathbb C}$$This can be seen as a generalization to its counterpart on $\mathbb A_{\mathbb R}^3$. 
- **Ideal-variety correspondence**: the curve is a zero-locus given by $$C=V(I)\where I=(\set{y-x^2,z-x^3})$$while the ideal of the variety is $$I(C)=(y-x^2,z-x^3)$$therefore the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is verified. 
- **Irreducibility**: The map $\phi$ induces a ring isomorphism $A(C) \cong \mathbb{C}[t]$ by sending $$x \mapsto t, y \mapsto t^2, z \mapsto t^3$$Since $\mathbb{C}[t]$ is an integral domain, $C$ is an **affine variety**.
- **Dimension**: The Krull dimension of $\mathbb{C}[t]$ is 1, confirming $C$ is a **curve**.
- **Zariski Open Sets**: Consider the principal open set $D(x) = \{ (t, t^2, t^3) \in C : t \neq 0 \}$. This set is the entire curve minus the origin $(0,0,0)$. As expected in the Zariski topology, this open set is dense in $C$.
