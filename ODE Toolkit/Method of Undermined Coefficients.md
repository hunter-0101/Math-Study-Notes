This works when we're able to guess the correct form of solution. In this situation the coefficient can be introduced as a parameter and obtained by substitution.
- **Coefficient at multipliers**: for non-homogeneous equations of the form$$a_n\frac{d^n y}{dt^n}+a_{n-1}\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dt^{n-1}}+\cdots+a_0y=f(t)$$we consider to assume a particular solution $y_p(t)$ based on the form of $f(t)$. Typical forms include:
	- For polynomials: $y_p(t)$ is a polynomial of the same degree.
	- For exponentials: $y_p(t) = Ae^{rt}$.
	- For sines and cosines: $y_p(t) = A\cos(\omega t) + B\sin(\omega t)$.
	- When $f$ contains $e^{\lambda t}$ where $\lambda$ is the characteristic root of order $k$, then we need to **multiply the solution by $t^k$**.
		- This is because in this case any $t^ie^{\lambda t}(1\le i\le k-1)$ is a solution to the homogeneous equation, thus we need a higher power to prevent it from vanishing. Another way to interpret this is the following annihilator method.
	- **Annihilator method**: to solve $P(D)x=f(t)$ we try to find another $A(D)$ (the annihilator) such that $A(D)f(t)=0$. Now apply $A(D)$ on both sides of the original equation we get $$A(D)P(D)x=0$$which can be solved easily. Now any $P(D)x=f(t)$ suits the above equation, thus we only need to determine the proper coefficients of the general solution to obtain the solution of the original equation. Note that when $f(t)$ contains $e^{\lambda t}$ where $\lambda$ is the characteristic root of $P(D)x=0$ of order $k$, then in the general solution there would be a term $t^k$, resulting in the extra $t^k$ in the method of undetermined coefficients.
- **Coefficients at exponents**: for Euler's equation $$\sum_{i=0}^na_it^ix^{(i)}=0,\quad a_i\in\mathbb R$$we may assume that $x(t)=t^\lambda$, which yields the characteristic equation $$\sum_{i=0}^na_i\lambda^{\underline i}=0\quad\text{where}\quad \lambda^{\underline i}=\lambda(\lambda-1)\cdots(\lambda-i+1)$$the rest is similar to that in [[Linear ODE]], except that for repeated roots we need $\ln x$ for translation when they're nonzero.
