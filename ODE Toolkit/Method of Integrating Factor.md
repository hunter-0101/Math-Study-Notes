Consider the [[First Order ODE]] $$\frac{dy}{dt}+p(x)y=g(x)$$We want to find some proper $\mu$ such that LHS is a derivative of $\mu(x)y$. It's not hard to notice that the following expression is a possible choice: $$\begin{align}\mu(x)&=\exp\left(\int p(x)dt\right)\\y&=\frac{1}{\mu(x)}\Big(\int_{t_0}^t\mu(s)g(s)ds+c\Big)\end{align}$$For a more general $M(x,y)dx+N(x,y)dy=0$, the integrating factor should satisfy $$M\mu_y-N\mu_x+(M_y-N_x)\mu=0$$which is at least as hard as  the original equation, thus we usually require $\mu=\mu(x)$, leading to$$\frac{d\mu}{dx}=\frac{M_y-N_x}{N}\mu$$note that the condition for $\mu=\mu(x)$ is that there exist some $h(x)$ such that $$\frac{\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}}{N}=h(x)$$in this case the integrating factor is exactly $\mu(x)=\exp\int h(x)dx$.
- **Geometric interpretation**: we're basically trying to transform a non-exact equation into an exact one, which can be easily solved by finding the **potential function**. The key idea of the method of integrating factor is to **adjust the rate of change along each axis** to qualify the 1-form for a potential field - i's a re-weighting of the "infinitesimal work" that converts a nonconservative field into a conservative one, while keeping the same trajectories..
	- **Example**: consider how $y=x\cdot f(x)$ is obtained by adjusting the value of $y=f(x)$ at each x-coordinate. Its value at $x$ is multiplied by $x$, which serves as the "stretching factor".
- **Differential form interpretation**: consider the differential 1-form $$\omega=M(x,y)dx+N(x,y)dy$$by the arithmetic property in [[Exterior Algebra]] we have $$d\omega=0\quad\iff\quad\partial_yM=\partial_xN$$and when the above does not hold, we may consider take $\mu:U\to\mathbb R$ so that $$\partial_y(\mu M)=\partial_x(\mu N)$$that is, integrating factors are the **pointwise scalings** that trivialize the cohomology class ([[De Rham Theory]]) of $\omega$.
- **Discussion**: as discussed below, finding integrating factor boils down to solving a [[First Order PDE]], while to this end the most common method is the method of characteristics, which itself requires solving a first order ODE. This seems a fatal loop, but in practical scenarios: 
	- **Different problems, different difficulty**: the characteristic ODE system is often easier to integrate than the original task, and many common forms (homogeneous polynomials, radial fields, linear fields, etc.) yield simple characteristic ODEs.
	- **Local existence is guaranteed, explicit formula not always needed**: the transport PDE for $\mu$ is linear along characteristics, so locally you can prescribe $\mu$ on a transversal and integrate to obtain $\mu$ in a neighborhood. That gives existence and - if you only need qualitative or numerical information - suffices. You don’t always need a closed-form $\mu$.
	- **Simple geometry and symmetry**: most of the time we can guess a proper integrating factor based on the form of the DE, or utilize some explicit symmetry of the field.
## Family of integrating factors
Since the integrating factor is verified via $\partial_y(\mu M)=\partial_x(\mu N)$, which can be expanded into $$M\partial_y\mu-N\partial_x\mu=\mu(N_x-M_y)$$we know that it's actually a solution to an under-determined [[First Order PDE]]. There are two important facts about the family of solution to this PDE: 
- **Construction of new IF**: If $\mu(x,y)$ is an integrating factor for $M(x,y)dx+N(x,y)dy=0$ s.t.  $$\mu(x,y)(M(x,y)dx+N(x,y)dy)=dF(x,y)$$then for any non-zero smooth $G(z)$, $\mu(x,y)G(F(x,y))$ is also an integrating factor. This can be verified directly.
- **Solution formula**: If $\mu_1(x,y),\mu_2(x,y)$ are IF of $M(x,y)dx+N(x,y)dy=0$, then the general solution to the original equation is given by $$\frac{\mu_1(x,y)}{\mu_2(x,y)}=C,\quad C\in\mathbb R$$**Proof**: notice that $$\mu_1\omega=dF_1,\quad\mu_2\omega=dF_2\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\frac{dF_1}{dF_2}=\frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2}$$Integrating the relation gives the functional dependence $F_1=G(F_2)$, since any level set of $F_i$ is a solution, then naturally so is the level set of their local dependence. 
These two facts, combined together, yields the result that the family of IFs of a specific equation can be constructed by $$\text{IF}=\set{\mu G(F):G\text{ integrable},\mu(Mdx+Ndy)=dF}$$When an equation is complex and its integrating factor is non-obvious, we may consider to separate into groups of $M_idx+N_idy$, find IFs for each of them, and find the proper one that lies in all these sets of integrating factors.
- **Useful results**
	- Generally, for an equation of the form $M(x,y)dx+N(x,y)dy=0$ where $M,N$ are homogeneous, it has integrating factor $$\mu(x,y)=\frac{1}{xM(x,y)+yN(x,y)}$$
