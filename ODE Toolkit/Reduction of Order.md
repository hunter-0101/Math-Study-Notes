Reduction of order applies to homogeneous [[Linear ODE]] $Lx=0$ of any order. It is used when we know one solution $\phi$ and would like to clear it out from the equation. 
In general given $L\phi=0$ we consider $L(\phi x)=0$ whose LHS, by Leibniz rule ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]), can be written as $$L(\phi x)=\sum_{i=0}^na_i\sum_{k=0}^i\binom{i}{k}\phi^{(i-k)}x^{(k)}=\sum_{k=0}^n  x^{(k)}\sum_{i=k}^n\binom{i}{k}a_i\phi^{(i-k)}$$Notice the coefficient for $x$ is exactly $L\phi=0$, hence by setting $y=x'$ the equation $L(\phi x)=0$ can actually be transformed into a new $\hat Ly=0$ with $\deg\hat L=\deg L-1$. 
## Operator perspective
For a linear differential operator $L$ endowed with a function $f$ notice that $$(L\cdot f)g=L(fg)=\sum_{i=0}^na_iD^i(fg)=\sum_{i=0}^na_i\sum_{k=0}^i\binom{i}{k}f^{(i-k)}g^{k}=\sum_{k=0}^n g^{(k)}\sum_{i=k}^n\binom{i}{k}a_if^{(i-k)}$$Notice that the coefficient for $g$ is exactly $Lf$, hence we have that $$(L\cdot f)g=(\hat LD)g+(Lf)g,\quad\forall g$$This implies that we have in effect the following division algorithm ([[Euclidean Domain]]) by $D$: $$L\cdot f= \hat LD+Lf\quad\text{where}\quad\deg\hat L=\deg L-1$$Thus when $Lf=0$, i.e., $f$ is the solution of $Lx=0$ a reduction of order is realized.
## Algebraic perspective
Given [[Field]] $F$ define the **first Weyl algebra** as $$A_1(F)=F\braket{X,D}/(DX-XD=1)$$where any element in $A_1(F)$ is of the form $$L=\sum_{n=0}^{<\infty}a_nD^n\quad\text{where}\quad a_n\in F[X]$$We can view $C^\infty(\mathbb R)$ as a $A_1(F)$-[[Module]] $M$ and any $L\in A_1(F)$ a homomorphism on $M$.
