Define the **Chebyshev polynomial** (of the first kind) of order $n\in\mathbb N$ as $$T_n(x)=\cos(n\arccos x),\quad x\in[-1,1]\quad\iff\quad T_n(\cos\theta)=\cos(n\theta),\quad\theta\in[0,2\pi]$$The recurrence is $T_{n+1}=2xT_n-T_{n-1}$. Using the second definition we derive the third one $$T_n(x)=\frac{1}{2}(z^n+z^{-n})\quad\text{where}\quad |z|=1,\Re z=x$$These definitions are useful in different aspects. ![[Pasted image 20250521100406.png]]
- **Explicit expression**: $T_n$ starts with $2^{n-1}x^n$, and $T_{2n}$ only contains terms of even power, while $T_{2n-1}$ only contains terms of odd power. The first few polynomials are listed below: $$\begin{align}T_0(x)&=1\\T_1(x)&=x\\T_2(x)&=2x^2-1\\T_3(x)&=4x^3-3x\\T_4(x)&=8x^4-8x^2+1\\T_5(x)&=16x^5-20x^3+5x\end{align}$$A general formula derived from the complex number definition is $$T_n(x)=\sum_{m=0}^{\floor{n/2}}(-1)^m\left(\binom{n-m}{m}+\binom{n-m-1}{n-2m}\right)2^{n-2m-1}x^{n-2m}$$As a direct corollary, $T_{2n}$ is even while $T_{2n+1}$ is odd.
- **Orthogonality**: $T_n$ is a sequence of orthogonal polynomials with weight $w(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$. In particular, we have $$\int_{-1}^1T_n(x)T_m(x)\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}=\begin{cases}0,&n\neq m\\\pi,&n=m=0\\\frac{\pi}{2},&n=m\neq0\end{cases}$$this can be shown by setting $x=\cos\theta$ and utilize change of variable for integration.
- **Zeros**: there are $n$ zeros of $T_n$ on $[-1,1]$ given by $x_i=\cos\frac{2i+1}{2n}\pi$. We call them **Chebyshev zeros** or **Chebyshev nodes of the first kind**.
- **Extremum**: there are $n+1$ extrema over $[-1,1]$ given by $$T_n\left(\cos\frac{i\pi}{n}\right)=(-1)^i,\quad i=0,\cdots,n$$Hence $f=2^{1-n}T_n$ is a monic polynomial with minimal $L^\infty$ norm on $[-1,1]$. These points are referred to as **Chebyshev extrema** or **Chebyshev nodes of the second kind**.
- **Extremal property**: among all monic polynomials chebyshev polynomial has the smallest absolute value, since it verifies the conditions described in the Chebyshev's equi-oscillation theorem and uniqueness result ([[Polynomial Approximation]]).
- **Aliasing property**: there are two aliasing properties for two kinds of Chebyshev nodes: 
	1. **Aliasing at Chebyshev zeros**: given $n\ge1,0\le m\le n$ we have $$T_{2kn\pm m}(x_j)=(-1)^kT_m(x_j),\quad\forall k\in\mathbb N$$where $x_j$ are the Chebyshev zeros.
	   **Proof**: we can deduce this similarly as the next property.
	2. **Aliasing at Chebyshev extrema**: given $n\ge1,0\le m\le n$ the Chebyshev polynomials $T_{2kn\pm m},k\in\mathbb N$ takes the same values at the extrema of $T_n$. 
	   **Proof**: by $T_n(x)=(z^n+z^{-n})/2$ and the correspondence below the above is equivalent to $z^{2kn\pm m}+z^{-(2kn\pm m)},\forall k\in\mathbb N$ taking the same values at $(2n)$-th roots of unity. This is  obvious since $\xi_{2n}^j$ is turned into $1$ under $2kn$ as exponent.
## Chebyshev series
Given appropriate $f$ define on $[-1,1]$ its **Chebyshev series** expansion is of the form $$f(x)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N} a_nT_n(x)\quad\text{where}\quad a_n=\frac{2-\delta_0^n}{\pi}\int_{-1}^1\frac{f(x)T_n(x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx$$Here $a_n$ are referred to as **Chebyshev coefficients**. Notice that via $z\mapsto x=\Re z$ we construct $F(z)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}a_n(z^k+z^{-n})$ the Laurent series ([[Holomorphic Function]]) and further we construct [[Fourier Series]] via $\theta\mapsto z=e^{i\theta}$. The corresponding canonical systems of grids are also explicit: $$x_j=\cos\frac{j}{n}\pi,0\le j\le n\quad\Longrightarrow\quad z_j=e^{i\frac{j}{n}\pi},-n<j\le n\quad\iff\quad\theta_j=\frac{j\pi}{n},-n<j\le n$$It's worth noting that $\Longleftarrow$ is not valid in general since it requires $F(z)=F(z^{-1}),\forall|z|=1$.
- **Basis property**: $\set{T_n}$ forms a complete orthogonal system for $C([-1,1])$. [[Hilbert Space]]
- **Convergence**: $f$ Lipschitz continuous ([[Function on Euclidean Space]]) on $[-1,1]$ has a unique representation as Chebyshev series as above, which is absolutely and uniformly convergent.
  **Proof**: setting $x=\Re z$ we find that $$dx=\frac{1}{2}(1-z^{-2})dz=\sgn(\Im z) iz^{-1}\sqrt{1-x^2}dz$$Since $F$ is also Lipschitz continuous by construction, by [[Fourier Series]] it has a unique FS representation on unit circle that convergence uniformly and absolutely, given by $$F(z)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}a_n(z^n+z^{-n})=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}a_nT_n(x)$$Meanwhile, by [[Cauchy Integral]] along opposite directions for [[Contour Integral]] we have $$\begin{align}a_n&=\frac{1}{\pi i}\int_{|z|=1}z^{-1+n}F(z)dz=\frac{1}{\pi i}\int_{|z|=1}z^{-1-n}F(z)dz&\text{Since }F(z)=F(z^{-1})\\&=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|z|=1}(z^{-i+n}+z^{-1-n})F(z)dz&\text{Taking average}\\&=\frac{1}{\pi i}\int_{|z|=1}z^{-1}T_n(x)F(z)dz&\text{Definition of }T_n(x)\\&=-\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{|z|=1}\frac{f(x)T_n(x)}{\sgn(\Im z)\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx\\&=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{-1}^1\frac{f(x)T_n(x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx\end{align}$$with half the coefficient for $n=0$. This is exactly the $a_n$ above, completing the proof.
- **Aliasing formula**: given $f$ Lipschitz continuous on $[-1,1]$ and $p_n$ its Chebyshev interpolant of the second kind in $\mathbb P_n,n\ge1$, denote $\set{a_n},\set{c_n}$ the Chebyshev coefficients of $f,p_n$, then $$\begin{align}c_0&=\sum_{i\in\mathbb N}a_{2in}\\ c_n&= \sum_{i\in\mathbb N}a_{(2i+1)n}\\ c_k&=a_k+\sum_{i\ge1}a_{k+2in}+\sum_{i\ge1}a_{-k+2in},\quad\forall 1\le k<n\end{align}$$**Proof**: by absolute convergence we can rearrange terms arbitrarily, and in particular the above series can be rearrange arbitrarily, being the Chebyshev series evaluated at $1$, hence indeed convergence to some $c_k$. Now take $$p_n=\sum_{k=0}^nc_kT_k\in\mathbb P_n$$By the aliasing property for any $x_j=\cos\frac{j\pi}{n},0\le j\le n$ we have $$\begin{align}p_n(x_j)&=\sum_{i\in\mathbb N}a_{2in}T_0(x_j)+\sum_{i\in\mathbb N} a_{(2i+1)n}T_n(x_j)+\left(a_k+\sum_{i\ge1}a_{k+2in}+\sum_{i\ge1}a_{-k+2in}\right)T_k(x_j)\\&=\sum_{k\in\mathbb N}a_kT_k(x_j)\\&=f(x_j)\end{align}$$hence $p_n$ is exactly the unique Chebyshev interpolant. [[Polynomial Interpolation]]
	- **Intuition**: we can interpret the result as that, the Chebyshev series of Chebyshev interpolant is obtained by reassigning all the Chebyshev coefficients in the infinite series of $f$ to their aliases of degrees $0$ through $n$.
## Chebyshev interpolation
**Chebyshev interpolation** of the first/second kind refers to the [[Polynomial Interpolation]] through Chebyshev nodes of the first/second kind.
- **[[Polynomial Interpolation]]**: Runge's phenomenon happens if we use uniform interpolation points, since the remainder term estimation is $$R_n(x)\le\frac{\|f^{(n+1)}\|_\infty}{(n+1)!}\prod_{i=0}^n|x-x_i|$$To mitigate this we try to minimize $\prod|x-x_i|$ over $[-1,1]$, and by discussion in [[Polynomial Approximation]] this is achieved exactly at the Chebyshev nodes $x_i$. In general on the interval $[a,b]$ the remainder estimation now becomes $$|R_n(x)|\le\frac{\|f^{(n+1)}\|_\infty}{(n+1)!}\frac{(b-a)^{n+1}}{2^{2n+1}}$$This is the best we can do when nothing is known about the function to be interpolated.
- **[[Polynomial Approximation]]**: the minimax polynomial, although exists and is unique, has no explicit expression and cannot be calculated directly. However, for Chebyshev interpolation on $[-1,1]$ the estimation expression yields the inequality $$\frac{\min_{[-1,1]}f^{(n+1)}}{2^n(n+1)!}\le R_n\le\frac{\max_{[-1,1]}f^{(n+1)}}{2^n(n+1)!}$$hence it's near minimax approximation when $f^{(n+1)}$ variate small on $[-1,1]$.
- **Convergence**: denote $L_n$ the Chebyshev interpolation operator of the first kind, then for $f$ Lipschitz continuous we have $L_nf$ converging uniformly to $f$.
  **Proof**: denote $R_nf=L_nf(x)-f(x)$ given fixed $x\in[-1,1]$, then $$|R_nT_k|=|(-1)^rT_m(x)-T_k(x)|\le2\quad\text{where}\quad m=\begin{cases}k\bmod 2n,&k\bmod 2n\le n\\ 2n-k\bmod 2n,&k\bmod 2n>n\end{cases}$$by uniqueness ([[Polynomial Interpolation]]) and aliasing property. Meanwhile, by linearity and uniqueness of [[Polynomial Interpolation]] we have $$R_nf=\sum_{i=n}^\infty a_i R_nT_i\le2\sum_{i=n}^\infty|a_i|$$Hence when $\sum a_n$ converges absolutely we have the uniform convergence of $L_nf$, which is guaranteed by Lipschitz continuity of $f$, as discussed above.
	- **Discussion**: using the second aliasing property we can deduce an analogous result for Chebyshev interpolation of the second kind.
