The **energy method** is a functional-analytic technique used to establish the qualitative properties of solutions to PDEs (**uniqueness**, **stability**, and **existence**) by identifying a scalar-valued function $\mathcal{E}(t)$, typically representing a norm in a [[Hilbert Space]] (e.g., $L^2$ or $H^1$), that evolves monotonically or remains conserved under the flow of the differential operator.
- **Physical origin**: for many physical systems, $\mathcal{E}(t)$ corresponds to the actual physical energy. Typical examples include:
	- Kinetic plus potential energy in mechanical waves ([[Motion]]), 
	- Internal thermal energy.
- **Multiplier method**: typically, an energy estimate is constructed by finding a proper **multiplier** $M(u)$ such that the pairing $\langle Lu, M(u) \rangle$ can be expressed as a total derivative in time plus a non-negative spatial divergence (using Green's theorems in [[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]]).
	- **First-order in time ($u_t$ vs $\Delta u$)**: use $u$ as a multiplier to match the $L^2$ structure of the heat equation.
	- **Second-order in time ($u_{tt}$ vs $\Delta u$)**: use $u_t$ as a multiplier. This creates a "perfect square" for the time derivative $\frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dt}(u_t^2)$, mirroring the Hamiltonian structure of classical mechanics.
	- **Advection terms ($b \cdot \nabla u$)**: these often require the multiplier $u$ to show that advection simply redistributes energy without changing the total $L^2$ norm (provided $\text{div}(b) = 0$).
- **Characteristics of energy function**
	- **Global vs. local**: estimates can be global (integrated over the entire spatial domain $\Omega$) or local (integrated over a "light cone" or domain of dependence), the latter being crucial for hyperbolic equations to prove finite propagation speed.
	- **Priori Nature**: these estimates are "a priori," meaning they are derived assuming a smooth solution exists, and subsequently used to prove that any such solution must be unique or continuously dependent on initial data.
## Uniqueness of solution
To prove uniqueness for a linear BVP $$\begin{cases}Lu=f,&\text{on }I\\\text{initial condition},&\text{on }I\\\text{boundary condition},&\text{for t>0}\end{cases}$$We consider the difference of two solutions $w = u - v$, which satisfies the homogeneous problem $Lw = 0$ with zero initial/boundary data. We'll usually find a quantity of the form $$\mathcal E(t)=\int_0^Le(x,t)dx$$that is constant or non-increasing, and whose value at $t=0$ depends only on the initial data. With these information it's usually possible to deduce an uniqueness theorem for the PDE.
- **Heat equation (parabolic)**: consider the [[Heat Equation]] problem $$\begin{cases}w_t-\alpha w_{xx}=0,&(x,t)\in[0,L]\times(0,\infty)\\w(x,0)=0,&x\in[0,L]\\w(0,t)=w(L,t)=0,&t>0\end{cases}$$Multiplying by $w$ and integrating over $I=[0,L]$ we get $$\int_Iww_tdx=\alpha\int_Iww_{xx}dx$$Using the identity $w w_t = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(w^2)$ and integration by parts: $$\frac{d}{dt}\mathcal E(t)=\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} \|w(\cdot, t)\|_{L^2}^2 \right) = \alpha \left[ w w_x \right]_0^L - \alpha \int_I (w_x)^2 dx = -\alpha \|w_x\|_{L^2}^2 \le 0$$Since $\mathcal{E}(0) = \frac{1}{2}\|w(x,0)\|^2 = 0$ and $\mathcal{E}'(t) \le 0$, it follows $\mathcal{E}(t) \le 0$. Since the integrand is non-negative, $w \equiv 0$. 
- **Wave equation (hyperbolic)**: consider the [[Wave Equation]] problem $$\begin{cases}w_{tt}-c^2\Delta w=0,&x\in\Omega,t>0\\w(x,0)=0,&x\in\Omega\\w_t(x,0)=0,&x\in\Omega\end{cases}$$The multiplier is $w_t$. Integrating $$\int_\Omega w_t (w_{tt} - c^2 \Delta w) dx = 0\imply\frac{d}{dt} \int_\Omega \frac{1}{2} \paren{w_t^2 + c^2 |\nabla w|^2} dx - c^2 \int_{\partial \Omega} w_t \frac{\partial w}{\partial n} dS = 0$$By boundary condition we deduce that $$\frac{d}{dt} \mathcal{E}(t) = 0 \implies \mathcal{E}(t) = \mathcal{E}(0) = 0$$This implies $w_t = 0$ and $\nabla w = 0$, hence $w$ is constant; the initial condition $w(x,0)=0$ ensures $w \equiv 0$. 
- **Poisson's equation (elliptic)**: consider the [[Laplace's Equation]] $$\begin{cases}\Delta w=0,&x\in\Omega\\w=0,&x\in\partial\Omega\end{cases}$$Multiplying by $w$ and integrating yields $$\int_\Omega w \Delta w dx = 0 \imply -\int_\Omega |\nabla w|^2 dx + \int_{\partial \Omega} w \frac{\partial w}{\partial n} dS = 0$$Since $w=0$ on $\partial \Omega$, we have $\int_\Omega |\nabla w|^2 dx = 0$, implying $w$ is constant. The boundary condition forces $w \equiv 0$. 
- **Schrödinger equation**: consider $i u_t + \Delta u = 0$. The "energy" here is the $L^2$ norm, often interpreted as total probability or mass. Multiply by the complex conjugate $\bar{u}$ and take the imaginary part we get $$\text{Im} \int_{\Omega} (i u_t \bar{u} + \Delta u \bar{u}) dx = 0 \implies \frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \int |u|^2 dx = 0$$The insight here is that, unlike the heat equation, the Schrödinger equation does not dissipate energy; it redistributes phase.
## Stability of solution
Stability implies that small perturbations in initial data or source terms result in small perturbations in the solution. We quantify this using energy inequalities. The main tool we'll use is the **Grönwall’s inequality** (differential form) discussed in [[Comparison Theorem]]: given $\eta(t)$ non-negative, differentiable, satisfying $\eta'(t) \le \phi(t) \eta(t) + \psi(t)$, we have: $$\eta(t) \le e^{\int_0^t \phi(s) ds} \left[ \eta(0) + \int_0^t \psi(s) ds \right]$$Of course other inequalities are also used for more advanced, complicated problems. 
- **Inhomogeneous [[Heat Equation]]**: consider $u_t - \Delta u = f(x,t)$ with $u(x,0) = g(x)$. Repeating the $L^2$ estimate gets us $$\frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \|u\|^2 + \|\nabla u\|^2 = \int_\Omega f u dx$$Applying Cauchy-Schwarz and Young's inequality ([[Lp Space]]): $$\frac{1}{2} \frac{d}{dt} \|u\|^2 + \|\nabla u\|^2 \le \frac{1}{2} \|f\|^2 + \frac{1}{2} \|u\|^2$$Dropping the non-negative $\|\nabla u\|^2$ term: $$\frac{d}{dt} \|u\|^2 \le \|u\|^2 + \|f\|^2$$By Grönwall's Inequality: $$\|u(\cdot, t)\|_{L^2}^2 \le e^t \left( \|g\|_{L^2}^2 + \int_0^t \|f(\cdot, s)\|_{L^2}^2 ds \right)$$This inequality proves that the $L^2$ norm of the solution is bounded by the $L^2$ norms of the data, ensuring stability.
- **Damped [[Wave Equation]]**: consider $u_{tt} + \gamma u_t - c^2 u_{xx} = 0$ with $\gamma > 0$. Multiplying by $u_t$: $$\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} \int (u_t^2 + c^2 u_x^2) dx \right) = -\gamma \int u_t^2 dx \le 0$$This shows that the energy is strictly non-increasing. Specifically, the presence of the damping term $\gamma u_t$ ensures that the system is even "more" stable than the standard wave equation, as energy dissipates over time.
- **$H^1$ stability**: in many non-linear contexts, $L^2$ stability is insufficient. We often require estimates on derivatives.
	- Example A: For the heat equation, one can multiply by $-\Delta u$ to obtain: $$\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} \|\nabla u\|^2 \right) = -\|\Delta u\|^2 \le 0$$This provides stability in the $H^1$ seminorm. 
	- **Example B**: In the Schrödinger equation $i u_t + \Delta u = 0$, multiplying by $\bar{u}$ shows $\|u\|_{L^2}$ is conserved, while multiplying by $\Delta \bar{u}$ (and taking the imaginary part) relates to the conservation of the Hamiltonian (energy), providing $H^1$ bounds.
