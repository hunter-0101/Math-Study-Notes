The **method of Fourier transform (FT)** ([[FT on L2]]) is a powerful analytical tool used to convert [[Linear PDE]] with **constant coefficients** into ODEs or algebraic equations. By mapping **spatial domain** to the frequency domain, the differential operator $\partial_{x_j}$ is replaced by a multiplicative algebraic operator $2\pi i\xi_j$, effectively "**diagonalizing**" the derivative.
- **Core idea**: for a PDE in $u(x, t)$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we apply $\mathcal{F}$ with respect to the spatial variables. The transform maps the function $u$ from the physical space to the frequency space: $$\hat{u}(\xi, t) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-2\pi ix\xi} u(x, t) dx$$This reduces the order of the PDE or converts it into a family of ODEs indexed by the frequency parameter $\xi$.
- **Requirements**
	- **Domain requirement**: this method is naturally suited for [[Cauchy Problem]] defined on **unbounded domains** (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^n$). For bounded domains, Fourier series is usually more applicable, e.g., [[Separation of Variables]].
	- **Linearity & coefficients**: this method is applicable to **linear PDE** with **constant coefficients**. If coefficients depend on $x$, the transform results in a convolution, usually complicating the problem further.
	- **Decay at Infinity:** for the transform to exist and for integration by parts to be valid, $u$ and its derivatives must satisfy specific decay conditions, typically $u \in L^1(\mathbb{R}^n) \cap L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ or $u \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ (the Schwartz space).
		- **Discussion**: if we're discussing [[Weak Solution]] under[[Distribution]] theory then this is not a problem we should worry about. 
	- **Initial/Boundary conditions**: initial conditions are transformed into "initial values" for the resulting ODE. In half-space problems, the transform is applied only to the variables spanning the boundary.
- **Effect of dimensionality**: even for the same type of equation, Fourier transform could yield different dynamics in different dimensions. For instance, in the Heat equation, dimension only changes the normalization constant; in the Wave equation, dimension fundamentally changes the qualitative behavior (e.g., sharp signals in 3D vs. "afterglow" in 2D). 
## Examples
- **[[Heat Equation]]**: consider the IVP for $u(x, t)$: $$\begin{cases} u_t - k\Delta u = 0, & x \in \mathbb{R}^n, t > 0 \\ u(x, 0) = g(x), & x \in \mathbb{R}^n \end{cases}$$Apply FT to the spatial variables: $$\partial_t \hat{u}(\xi, t) + k|2\pi\xi|^2 \hat{u}(\xi, t) = 0$$This is a first-order linear ODE in $t$. The solution is $$\hat{u}(\xi, t) = \hat{g}(\xi) e^{-kt|2\pi\xi|^2}$$Recognize $e^{-kt|2\pi\xi|^2}$ as the transform of the Gaussian $$K_t(x) = \frac{1}{(4\pi kt)^{n/2}} e^{-\frac{|x|^2}{4kt}}$$By the convolution theorem the final solution is $$u(x, t) = (g * K_t)(x) = \frac{1}{(4\pi kt)^{n/2}} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-\frac{|x-y|^2}{4kt}} g(y) dy$$
- **[[Wave Equation]]**: consider 3D wave equation to observe the effect of the dispersion relation: $$\begin{cases} u_{tt} - c^2\Delta u = 0, & x \in \mathbb{R}^3, t > 0 \\ u(x, 0) = f(x)\\ u_t(x, 0) = g(x) \end{cases}$$Apply FT to the spacial variable: $$\hat{u}_{tt} + c^2|2\pi\xi|^2 \hat{u} = 0$$The general solution of this ODE is $$\hat{u}(\xi, t) = A(\xi) \cos(c|2\pi\xi|t) + B(\xi) \frac{\sin(c|2\pi\xi|t)}{c|2\pi\xi|}$$Substitute the expression back into IC $$A(\xi) = \hat{f}(\xi),\quad B(\xi) = \hat{g}(\xi)$$Inverting $\dfrac{\sin(c|2\pi\xi|t)}{c|2\pi\xi|}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ involves distributions (spherical shells). The solution leads to **Kirchhoff's Formula**, illustrating that the solution at $(x, t)$ depends only on the data on the sphere $\partial B(x, ct)$ (Huygens' Principle).
- **[[Laplace's Equation]]**: Consider $\Delta u = 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and $y > 0$, with $u(x, 0) = h(x)$. Apply FT only to the $x$ variables ($n-1$ dimensions): $$\hat{u}_{yy}(\xi, y) - |2\pi\xi|^2 \hat{u}(\xi, y) = 0$$The general solution is $$\hat{u}(\xi, y) = A(\xi) e^{-|2\pi\xi|y} + B(\xi) e^{|2\pi\xi|y}$$Since we require $u \to 0$ as $y \to \infty$ (or $u \in L^2$), we must set $B(\xi) = 0$. Apply BC: $$\hat{u}(\xi, 0) = A(\xi) = \hat{h}(\xi)\imply\hat{u}(\xi, y) = \hat{h}(\xi) e^{-|2\pi\xi|y}$$The term $e^{-|2\pi\xi|y}$ is the transform of the Poisson Kernel $P_y(x)$: $$u(x, y) = \frac{2y}{\omega_n} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n-1}} \frac{h(z)}{(|x-z|^2 + y^2)^{n/2}} dz$$
