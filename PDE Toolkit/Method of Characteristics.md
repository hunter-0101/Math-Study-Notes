The **Method of Characteristics** reduces a first-order PDE to a [[Linear ODE System]] by identifying specific curves - **characteristic curves** - along which the PDE evolves as an ODE.
In general, consider the general first order [[Linear PDE]] of the form $$Lu=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i(x)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}=f(x)$$Consider a parametric curve $C\subset\mathbb R^n$ as follows, and utilize [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]] to rewrite the original equation as $$C(t)=(x_1(t),\cdots,x_n(t))\in\mathbb R^n\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\frac{du}{dt}=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}\frac{dx_i}{dt}$$Notice its similarity in form with PDE, if we first solve the [[Linear ODE System]] $$\frac{dx_i}{dt}=\alpha_i(x),\quad\forall 1\le i\le n$$then the solution curve (referred to as the **characteristic curve**) can be obtained, and along this curve the original PDE is transformed into a simple [[First Order ODE]] $$\frac{du}{dt}=f(x(t))$$and the above two equations, combined together, yields the solution to the original PDE. The solution obtained contains a undetermined coefficient, and when a BV is given we can use the solution to the system $\frac{dx_i}{dt}=\alpha_i(x)$ to determine its expression in terms of $x_i$, and by substitution an exact solution can be obtained. 
- **Intuition**: a linear first order PDE specifies the directional derivative ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) of $u$ along the vector field $a=(a_1,\cdots,a_n)$. By moving along the integral curves of $a$, the multivariate problem collapses into a univariate one.
- **Extension to higher-order operators**: for higher-order PDEs, the method is applicable if the operator can be factorized into first-order components. For instance, for a [[Wave Equation]] we can decompose the differential operator as $$\partial_{tt}-\partial_{xx}=(\partial_t-\partial_x)(\partial_t+\partial_x)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\begin{cases} u_t-u_x=v\\v_t+v_x=0\end{cases}$$Then the method of characteristics can be applied iteratively on them. 
- **Quasi-linear PDE**: if $a_i$ depends on $u$, i.e., being a **variable coefficient**, the curves depend on the boundary data, potentially leading to **crossing characteristics** (shocks). 
### Example
- **Basic first order PDE**: We try to solve the BVP $$\begin{cases}\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial t}+(x+t)\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x}+u=x,&x\in\mathbb R,t>0\\u(x,0)=x\end{cases}$$by introducing a new parameter $s$ we get $$\begin{cases}\dfrac{dt}{ds}=1\\\dfrac{dx}{ds}=x+t\\x(0)=c\end{cases}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad x(t)=e^t(1+c)-(1+t)$$here we're substituting $s$ directly with $t$ by the first equation, which is **quite common** in practical scenarios. Now by the above substitution the original PDE is transformed into $$\begin{cases}\dfrac{du}{dt}+u(t)=e^t(1+c)-(1+t)\\u(0)=u(x(0),0)=u(c,0)=c\end{cases}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad u(t)=\frac{1}{2}(c+1)e^t+\frac{1}{2}(c-1)e^{-t}-t$$since we can solve from the solution of ODEs to get $$c=(x+t+1)e^{-t}-1$$by substitution the final solution to the BVP is $$u(x,t)=\frac{1}{2}e^{-2t}(x+t+1)-e^{-t}+\frac{1}{2}(x-t+1)$$
- **Special BV**: we try to solve the BVP $$\begin{cases}u_{tt}-u_{xx}=0,&x\in\mathbb R,t>at\\u|_{t=ax}=u_0(x),&x\in\mathbb R\\ u_t|_{t=ax}=u_1(x),&x\in\mathbb R\end{cases}$$The first idea is to decompose the second order differential operator into $$\partial_{tt}-\partial_{xx}=(\partial_t+\partial_x)(\partial_t-\partial_x)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\begin{cases} u_t-u_x=v\\v_t+v_x=0\end{cases}$$Now the key challenge is the transformed BV: for $u$ this is direct, but for $v$ we need to notice that in $v(x,t)=u_x(x,t)-u_x(x,t)$ the second term is not explicitly given. To this end we utilize the chain rule ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) to get $$u_0'(x)=\frac{d u(x,ax)}{dx}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dx}+\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\frac{d(ax)}{dx}=u_x(x,ax)+au_t(x,ax)$$hence we can deduce that $$u_x(x,ax)=u_0'(x)-au_t(x,ax)=u_0'(x)-au_1(x)$$which implies that the BV for $v$ is $$v(x,ax)=u_t(x,ax)-u_x(x,ax)=(1+a)u_1(x)-u_0'(x)$$Now we can apply the method of characteristics to the following two BVPs: $$\begin{cases}u_t-u_x=v\\u(x,ax)=u_0(x)\end{cases}\quad\text{and}\quad\begin{cases}v_t+v_x=0\\v(x,ax)=(1+a)u_1(x)-u_0'(x)\end{cases}$$A little bit more effort is required for solving these two BVPs. For the second problem, the characteristic is $x_1=t+c_1$, and its intersection with $t=ax$ is $$x=\frac{c}{1-a},\quad t=\frac{ac}{1-a}$$hence from the second BVP we have $$v(x,t)=v(x,ax)=(1+a)u_1\left(\frac{x-t}{1-a}\right)+u_0'\left(\frac{x-t}{1-a}\right)$$Similarly we derive the intersection for the first problem and use integration to derive $$u(x,t)=u_0\left(\frac{x+t}{1+a}\right)+\int_{\frac{a(x+t)}{1+a}}^t\left((1+a)u_1\left(\frac{x+t-2\tau}{1-a}\right)-u_0'\left(\frac{x+t-2\tau}{1-a}\right)\right)d\tau$$By direct simplification we get $$u(x,t)=\frac{1+a}{2}u_0\left(\frac{x+t}{1+a}\right)+\frac{1-a}{2}u_0\left(\frac{x-t}{1-a}\right)+\frac{1-a^2}{2}\int_\frac{x-t}{1-a}^\frac{x+t}{1+a}u_1(s)ds$$Now we finish the solving process of the original BVP. 
- **Inhomogeneous BVP with variable coefficients**: we try to solve: $$u_t + (x+t)u_x = x - u,\quad u(x,0) = x$$The characteristic ODEs is: $\frac{dt}{ds} = 1 \implies t = s$ (using $t$ as parameter) $$\frac{dx}{dt} = x+t \implies x(t) = (x_0+1)e^t - (t+1)$$Solve for $u$: $$\frac{du}{dt} = x - u = (x_0+1)e^t - (t+1) - u$$This is a linear ODE: $\frac{d}{dt}(ue^t) = (x_0+1)e^{2t} - (t+1)e^t$. Integrating and using $u(0) = x_0$: $$u(t) = \frac{1}{2}(x_0+1)e^t + \frac{1}{2}(x_0-1)e^{-t} - t$$Back-substitution: from $x(t)$, $$x_0 = (x+t+1)e^{-t} - 1$$Result: $$u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}e^{-2t}(x+t+1) - e^{-t} + \frac{1}{2}(x-t+1)$$
- **Quasi-linear PDE and Shock Formation**: to illustrate the method from the angle of non-linear geometry, consider the Inviscid Burgers' Equation: $$u_t + u u_x = 0, \quad u(x,0) = h(x)$$The characteristics are given by $$\frac{dt}{ds} = 1, \frac{dx}{ds} = u, \frac{du}{ds} = 0$$Analysis: $u$ is constant along characteristics $\implies \frac{dx}{dt} = u(x_0, 0) = h(x_0)$. The characteristics are straight lines: $x = h(x_0)t + x_0$. 
	- **Insight (Shock):** If $h'(x) < 0$ for some $x$, characteristics will intersect at time $T = \frac{-1}{\min h'(x)}$. At this point, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \to \infty$, and the Method of Characteristics fails to provide a single-valued classical solution, necessitating **Weak Solutions** and the **Rankine-Hugoniot condition**.
- **Transport with Source (Vector Method)**: we solve $$x u_x + y u_y = 2u,\quad u(x, 1) = g(x)$$**System:** $\frac{dx}{x} = \frac{dy}{y} = \frac{du}{2u}$. First Integrals: $\ln x - \ln y = C_1 \implies \frac{x}{y} = C_1$. $$\ln u - 2\ln y = C_2 \implies \frac{u}{y^2} = C_2$$**General Solution:** $$u/y^2 = \Phi(x/y) \implies u(x,y) = y^2 \Phi(x/y)$$**Apply BV:** $$u(x, 1) = 1^2 \Phi(x/1) = g(x) \implies \Phi(x) = g(x)$$**Final Solution:** $$u(x,y) = y^2 g(x/y)$$.
