A **$k$-jet** of a smooth function $f\in C_p^\infty(\mathbb R^m,\mathbb R^n)$ between [[Euclidean Space]] $\mathbb R^m,\mathbb R^n$ at point $p\in\mathbb R^m$ is defined as the equivalence class of functions having the same Taylor expansion ([[Taylor's Theorem]]) up to order $k$ (included): $$J_p^kf=\set{g\in C_p^\infty\paren{\mathbb R^m,\mathbb R^n}:\partial^\alpha f=\partial^\alpha g,\forall\abs{\alpha}\le k}$$Given two [[Smooth Manifold]] $M,N$ of dimensions $m,n\in\mathbb N$, two maps $f, g\in C_p^\infty(M,N)$ are said to have **$k$-order contact at $p\in M$** if $f(p) = g(p) = q$ and for any local charts $(U_p, \phi),(V_q, \psi)$ we have $$J_p^k\paren{\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}}=J_p^k\paren{\psi \circ g \circ \phi^{-1}}$$The **$k$-jet** of $f\in C_p^\infty(M,N)$ at $p\in M$ is defined as the equivalence class of smooth maps having $k$-order contact with $f$ at $p$. The set of all such jets is: $$J^k_p(M, N)= \Set{ J^k_p f : f \in C_p^\infty(M, N) }$$This concept naturally gives rise to a [[Fiber Bundle]] structure via $$J^k(M, N) = \bigcup_{p \in M} J_p^k(M, N)\xto\pi M$$which is termed the **$k$-th order jet bundle**.
- **Discussion on definition**: the definition above for jets relies on local coordinates, which is sort of bad. A coordinate-free way to define jet is to start with the jet bundle $J_p^k(\mathbb R,M)$, and then define $J_p^k(M,N)$ via equivalence class of curves $\gamma\in J_p^k(\mathbb R,M)$. 
- **Algebraic dimension**: the fiber dimension of $k$-th order jet bundle is given by $$\dim J_p^k(M, N)=n\sum_{d=0}^k\binom{m+d-1}{d}=n\binom{m+k}{k}$$where we've used the formula in [[Combination & Permutation]]. 
- **Contact Geometry:** $J^1(M, \mathbb{R})$ is the prototypical example of a contact manifold. The study of PDEs is essentially the study of sub-manifolds of jet spaces. 
- **Internal Tool: The Jet Transversality Theorem.** If $S \subset J^k(M, N)$ is a submanifold, then for "almost all" $f \in C^\infty(M, N)$, the $k$-jet extension $j^k f: M \to J^k(M, N)$ is transverse to $S$. This is a powerful tool for proving the existence of functions with specific generic singularities.
## Properties
To manipulate jets effectively, the following properties serve as the standard operational toolkit. 
- **Chain rule**: let $f \in C^\infty(M, N)$ and $g \in C^\infty(N, P)$. The $k$-jet of the composition is determined solely by the $k$-jets of the components: $$j^k_p (g \circ f) = j^k_{f(p)} g \circ j^k_p f$$In local coordinates, this corresponds to the substitution of Taylor polynomials and truncating terms of degree $> k$.
- **Truncation (projection)**: there exist natural projection maps $\pi_l^k: J^k(M, N) \to J^l(M, N)$ for any $0 \leq l \leq k$, defined by: $$\pi_l^k(j^k_p f) = j^l_p f$$This forms a tower of bundles. Notably, $\pi_0^k$ is the projection $J^k(M, N) \to M \times N$ sending $j^k_p f$ to $(p, f(p))$.
- **Coordinate independence**: if $h: M \to M$ and $k: N \to N$ are diffeomorphisms, the induced map on jet spaces preserves the equivalence classes. Formally, $j^k_p f = j^k_p g$ implies $j^k_{h^{-1}(p)} (k \circ f \circ h) = j^k_{h^{-1}(p)} (k \circ g \circ h)$.
## Example: 2nd-order jet of a scalar field
To observe the interplay of coordinate independence, the chain rule, and truncation, consider the function $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ at the origin $p = (0,0)$.
1. **Local Representation**: let $f(x, y) = x + y^2 + xy$. The 2nd-order jet at $0$ is represented by the polynomial: $$P(x, y) = x + xy + y^2$$Thus, $j^2_0 f = (0, 0, (1, 0), \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix})$ in terms of $(p, f(p), \nabla f, H_f)$, where $H_f$ is the Hessian.

2. **Coordinate Transformation (Angle 1: Covariance)**: consider a change of coordinates on the domain $\mathbb{R}^2$ via $x = u+v, y = v$. The new representation $$\tilde{f}(u, v) = (u+v) + v^2 + (u+v)v = u + v + uv + 2v^2$$The 2-jet $j^2_0 \tilde{f}$ is $u + uv + v + 2v^2$. Note that the linear part transformed by the Jacobian and the quadratic part by the Hessian formula. This confirms that while the coefficients change, the jet object remains the same equivalence class under the diffeomorphism $\phi(u,v) = (u+v, v)$.
3. **Chain rule and truncation (Angle 2: Composition)**: let $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be $g(z) = e^z$. We compute $j^2_0(g \circ f)$. The Taylor expansion of $g$ at $f(0)=0$ is $1 + z + \frac{1}{2}z^2 + \dots$. Using the composition property: $$j^2_0(g \circ f) = \text{Trunc}_2 \left[ 1 + (x + xy + y^2) + \frac{1}{2}(x + xy + y^2)^2 \right]$$Expanding the square and keeping only terms up to degree 2: $$j^2_0(g \circ f) = 1 + x + xy + y^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^2$$Note that the $x^2y$ and $x^2y^2$ terms are removed by the truncation property $\pi_2^\infty$. This result is exactly the same as calculating $j^2_0$ of the function $h(x,y) = e^{x+y^2+xy}$ directly.

Practical Tool: Calculating $J^k$ for Nonlinear Differential Operators

When solving a second-order PDE $F(x, u, \partial u, \partial^2 u) = 0$, we are searching for a section $s: M \to J^2(M, \mathbb{R})$ that lies in the zero-set of a function $\mathcal{F}: J^2(M, \mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$ and is "integrable" (i.e., $s = j^2 u$ for some $u$). The properties above allow us to check if such a PDE is well-defined under change of coordinates.
