 The **Sylow theorems** are a collection of theorems that give detailed information about the **number of subgroups of a given order** that a finite group contains. 
- **Cauchy's Theorem**: given $|G|<\infty$ we have $$p\in\mathbb P,p\mid|G|\imply\exists g\in G\ \st\ |g|=p$$**Proof**: consider the set $$S=\set{(x_1,\cdots,x_p):x_i\in G,x_1\cdots x_p=e}$$By the rule of product ([[Counting]]) and invertibility we have $|S|=|G|^{p-1}$. On $S$ we define $$a\sim b \qiffq  a\text{ is a cyclic permutation of }b$$Since cyclic group is simple ([[Group Gallery]]), every equivalence class is of order $1$ or $p$. Denote the number of these classes as $k,d$, then by double [[Counting]] we get $$|G|^{p-1}=k+pd$$Now since $(e,e,\cdots,e)\in S$ we have $k\ge1$, therefore by $p\mid k$ ([[Division]]) we deduce that $k\ge p$, which implies the existence of some $g\in G$ s.t. $|g|=p$. 
## Sylow theorems
Given finite [[Group]] $G$, a subgroup $H\le G$ is a **$p$- subgroup** if $|H|=p^k$ for some $k\in\mathbb N$, and is a **Sylow $p$-subgroup** if $$|H|=p^{\nu_p(|G|)}$$i.e., it's a subgroup having the largest possible power of a prime factor of $|G|$. The collection of all Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ and the number of elements it contains are usually denoted $$\syl_p(G)=\set{P\le G:P\text{ is a Sylow }p\text{-subgroup of }G},\quad n_p(G)\coloneqq\abs{\syl_p(G)}$$The Sylow theorems describes some of the most important properties of these concepts. 
- **Sylow's first theorem**: given $|G|<\infty$ we have $$p\in\mathbb P,k\in\mathbb N, p^k\mid|G|\imply\exists H\le G\ \st \ |H|=p^k$$**Proof**: consider the group action defined by $$G\act X:(g,A)\mapsto gA\where X=\Set{A\subset G:\abs{A}=p^k}$$By rule of product ([[Counting]]) we have $$|X|=\binom{n}{p^k}=\sum_{O_A}|O_A|$$Applying the results in [[Combination & Permutation]] and [[Division]] we have $$p^{l-k+1}\not\mid |X|\where \nu_p(|X|)=l\imply \exists O_A\ \st\ p^{l-k+1}\not\mid |O_A|$$Now applying the orbit-stabilizer theorem ([[Group Action]]) we have $$p^{l-k+1}\not\mid|G:G_A|=\frac{|G|}{|G_A|}\imply p^k\mid |G_A|$$Notice that $|G_A|\le|A|=p^k$, we know that $|G_A|=p^k$. 
- **Sylow's second theorem**: let $\nu_p(|G|)=l$ and $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup, then $$H\le G,|H|=p^k\le p^l\imply H\le gPg^{-1}\text{ for some }g\in G$$**Proof**: consider the group action $$H\act G/P:h(gP)\mapsto (hg)P$$We have $|G/P|=\sum|O_i|$, but notice that by [[Group Action]] we also have $$|O_i|\mid |H|=p^l,\quad\gcd(|G/P|,p)=1\imply|O_i|=1\text{ for some }O_i$$That is, there exists a coset $gP$ that is fixed by all $h\in H$, which implies that for any $h\in H$, $$hgP=gP\imply g^{-1}hgP=P\imply g^{-1}hg\in P\imply g^{-1}Hg\le P$$where we used the subgroup criterion ([[Group]]) for the second implication. 
- **Sylow's third theorem**: let $|G|=p^lm,(p,m)=1$, then $$n_p(G)|m,\quad n_p(G)\equiv1\pmod p$$**Proof**: consider the action by left multiplication $$G\act\syl_p(G):P\mapsto gP$$By Sylow's second theorem there is only one orbit. Pick $P\in\mathrm{Syl}_p(G)$, then by the orbit-stabilizer theorem ([[Group Action]]) we have $$p^lm=|G|=\abs{G_{\syl_p(G)}}\cdot|O_P|=\abs{G_{\syl_p(G)}}\cdot n_p(G)$$For the division relation it suffices to notice that ([[Division]]) $$P\le G_P\imply |P|=p^l\mid|G_P|\imply n_p(G)\mid m$$For the congruence relation, consider the action by conjugation $$P\act\syl_p(G):Q\mapsto pQp^{-1}$$By maximality of Sylow $p$-subgroup we know that there is only one fixed point, hence only one orbit of size $1$, while the rest orbits has length of powers of $p$, therefore $$n_p(G)=\abs{\syl_p(G)}\equiv1+pd\equiv1\pmod p$$where $d\in\mathbb N$ is some natural number determined by $G$. 
## Consequence of Sylow theorems
- Sylow II states that the subgroups within the same $\mathrm{Sym}_p(G)$ conjugates. 
	- When there is only one such subgroup, we immediately know that it is **normal**.
> [!info] Usage of conjugacy of Sylow subgroups
> $G$ is finite, $N\triangleleft G$, P is a Sylow subgroup of $N$, and $T=N_G(P)$. Show that $G=NT$.
> **Proof**: First it's easy to verify that $NT$ form a group.
> To proof $G=NT$ we only have to show $g=nt,\forall g\in G$, which can be done by showing $n^{-1}g\in T$ or $gt^{-1}\in N$ (because both $N,T$ are "normal"). Consider the **conjugacy relation of Sylow subgroups**, we know that $gP=(nPn^{-1})g\Rightarrow(n^{-1}g)P=P(n^{-1}g)$, thus $n^{-1}g\in T$. The proof is complete for the random choice of $g$.
- Sylow III put the constraint on the number of Sylow p-subgroup, which can be used to bound the number of Sylow p-subgroups.
## Other facts related to Sylow p-group
- If $P\le H\le G$ where $P$ is a Sylow subgroup of $G$, then $P$ is also a Sylow subgroup of $H$.
- For Sylow $P\le G$, we have $P\le N_G(P)=N_G(N_G(P))$.
	- **Proof**: obviously $N_G(P)\le N_G(N_G(P))$. On the other hand, for any $x\in N_G(N_G(P))$, we have $xPx^{-1}\le xN_G(P)x^{-1}=N_G(P)$. Since all Sylow p-subgroup are conjugate, and both $P,xPx^{-1}$ are Sylow subgroups of $N_G(P)$, there exists $y\in N_G(P)$ such that $xPx^{-1}=yPy^{-1}=P$, which shows that $x\in N_G(P)$. Thus $N_G(P)=N_G(N_G(P))$.
	- This also applies to any subgroup of $N_G(P)$.
