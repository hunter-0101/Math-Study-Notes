Given (finite) [[Group]] $G$ and [[Field]] $F$, a **[[Matrix]] representation** of $G$ is a [[Group Homomorphism]] $$\rho:G\to\gl(n,F)$$where $n\in\mathbb N$ is the **degree (dimension)** of the representation.
- **Faithful representation**: $\rho$ is called faithful if it's injective.
- **Equivalent representations**: $\rho_1,\rho_2$ are equivalent if there exists $P\in\gl(n,F)$ s.t. $$\rho_2=c_P\circ\rho_1\quad\text{where}\quad c_P:M\mapsto P^{-1}MP,\quad\forall M\in\gl(n,F)$$Similar to the idea of viewing matrix as a representation by linear transform ([[Vector Space]]), equivalence between representations allows us to define **linear transform representation** as a homomorphism $$\rho:G\to\gl(V)$$where $V$ is a vector space. Such representation is usually denoted $(\rho,V)$.
	- **Degenerated matrix representations**: obviously when a basis is specified for $V$ the definition degenerates to the representation as matrix. Given basis $A=\set{a_i},B=\set{b_i}$ for $V$ take $P$ the transformation matrix, then by [[Vector Space]] we have $$\rho^B=c_P\circ\rho^A$$by definition, hence degenerated matrix representations are equivalent.
- **regular representation**: by Cayley's theorem ([[Group Actions]]) we have a monomorphism $G\to S_G\cong S_{|G|}$. Given basis $B=\set{b_k},1\le k\le |G|$ for $\dim V=|G|$ we can define $$\rho(g):V\to V,\quad b_k\mapsto b_{g(k)}$$which is called a **regular (permutation) representation**.
- **Arithmetic operations**: given $(\rho,V),(\pi,W)$ for a group $G$, define their **direct sum** as $$\phi=\rho\oplus\pi:G\to\gl(V\oplus W),\quad\phi(g)(v,w)=(\rho(g)(v),\pi(g)(w)),\quad\forall (v,w)\in V\oplus W$$and their **tensor product** as $$\psi=\rho\otimes\pi:G\to\gl(V)\otimes\gl(W),\quad\psi(g)(v\otimes w)=\psi(g)(v)\otimes\psi(g)(w),\quad\forall v\otimes w\in V\otimes W$$
- **Dual representation**: given a representation $(\rho,V)$ we define its dual by $$\rho^*:G\to \gl(V^*),\quad g\mapsto(\circ\rho(g^{-1}))$$Such definition is motivated by the desired property $$\braket{\rho^*(g)(f),\rho(g)(v)}=\braket{f,v},\quad\forall g\in G,v\in V,f\in V^*$$where $\braket{f,v}=f(v)$ is the natural pairing.
	- The above duality generalize to any $\hom(V,W)$ given by $g\varphi(v)=g\varphi(g^{-1}v)$.
- **Homomorphism representation**: by $\hom(V,W)\cong V^*\otimes W$ we can to identify $\hom(V,W)$ as a representation of $G$.
- **Unitary representation**: given some inner product $\braket{\cdot,\cdot}$, a representation $\rho$ is unitary if $$\braket{\rho(g)(v),\rho(g)(u)}=\braket{u,v},\quad\forall g\in G,u,v\in V$$Notice that any representation $U$ can be made unitary by choosing proper inner product: $$\braket{v,u}_U=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\braket{U(g)(v),U(g)(u)}$$
## $G$-linear map
Given two representations $\rho_1:G\to\gl(V),\rho_2:G\to\gl(W)$ a **$G$-linear map** between $\rho_1,\rho_2$ is a linear map $L\in\mathcal L(V,W)$ s.t. the following diagram commutes for all $g\in G$: 
<p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%0A%5Cbegin%7Btikzcd%7D%0AV%20%5Carrow%5Br%2C%20%22%5Crho_1(g)%22%5D%20%5Carrow%5Bd%2C%20%22L%22'%5D%20%26%20V%20%5Carrow%5Bd%2C%20%22L%22%5D%20%5C%5C%0AW%20%5Carrow%5Br%2C%20%22%5Crho_2(g)%22'%5D%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%26%20W%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%0A%5Cend%7Btikzcd%7D%0A" /></p>
Intuitively, $L$ respects the group actions: $L(\rho_1(g)(x))=\rho_2(g)(L(x))$. 
- **Isomorphic representation**: if $L$ is an [[Vector Space]] isomorphism then $L^{-1}$ is also a $G$-linear map, and $\rho_1,\rho_2$ are said to be isomorphic (equivalent), denoted $\rho_1\cong\rho_2$. Obviously we have $$\rho_1\cong\rho_2\quad\iff\quad \rho_1^A\cong\rho_2^B$$for some $V=\span A,W=\span B$, where RHS is in the sense of [[Matrix]] similarity.
## Subrepresentation
A **subrepresentation** of $\rho:G\to\gl(V)$ is a vector subspace $W\subset V$ s.t. $$\rho(g)(x)\in W,\quad\forall g\in G,x\in W$$i.e., subrepresentation is constructed from representation by restriction of domain.
- Given a $G$-linear map $L:\rho_1\to\rho_2$ on $V,W$ respectively, $\ker L$ is a subrepresentation of $V$, and $\im L$ is a subrepresentation of $W$.
- **irreducibility**: $(\rho,,V)$ is said to be irreducible if the only subrepresentations are $(\rho,V)$ and $(\pi_0,\set{0})$.
	- The same group might have representations of different irreducibility. Say, $S_3$ has the regular representation $\rho:S_3\to\gl(\mathbb R^3)$, which has a subrepresentation on $\span((1,1,1)^T)$, while $D_6\cong S_3$ has a representation $$r\mapsto\begin{bmatrix}\cos\frac{2\pi}{3}&-\sin\frac{2\pi}{3}\\\sin\frac{2\pi}{3}&\cos\frac{2\pi}{3}\end{bmatrix},\quad s\mapsto\begin{bmatrix}-1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$$which is obviously irreducible.
	- **Irreducible component decomposition**: given $G$ finite and $(\rho, V)$ with $\dim V<\infty$ we have the direct sum decomposition $$V=\bigoplus_{i=1}^kV_i,\quad\rho(g)=\begin{bmatrix}\pi_1(g)\\&\pi_2(g)\\&&\ddots\\&&&\pi_k(g)\end{bmatrix}$$where $\pi_i:G\to\gl(V_i)$ are irreducible. The decomposition is unique up to permutation and isomorphism. We sometimes write $$V\cong\bigoplus_{i=1}^kV_i^{\oplus a_i}$$where $V_i$ are distinct (up to isomorphism), with $a_i$ being the multiplicity.
	  **Proof**: decomposition obvious by induction on $\dim\rho$, since given subrepresentation $(\pi,W)$ the group $G$ always defines an action on $W$ and $V/W$. For uniqueness it suffices to apply the Schur's orthogonality lemma stated below to the pairing of two different decompositions.
## Orthogonality
- **Schur's orthogonality lemma**: given $(\rho_1,V),(\rho_2,W)$ irreducible and $L:V\to W$ a $G$-linear map between $\rho_1,\rho_2$, then $L$ is either the 0 map or an isomorphism.
  **Proof**: since both $(\rho_1,V),(\rho_2,W)$ are irreducible, we have $$\begin{cases}\ker L=0\\\im L=W\end{cases}\quad\text{or}\quad\begin{cases} \ker L=V\\\im L=0\end{cases}$$hence $L$ is either the 0 map or an isomorphism.
	- **Corollary**: given $(\rho,V)$ irreducible and $L$ a $G$-linear map w.r.t $\rho$, then $L=\lambda I,\lambda\in F$.
	  **Proof**: it's known that $L$ is either the 0 map or an isomorphism. For the second case we pick a eigenvector $v\in V$ of $L$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$ ([[Eigendecomposition]]), then $$L(\rho(g)(v))=\rho(g)(Lv)=\rho(g)(\lambda v)=\lambda\rho(g)(v),\quad\forall g\in G$$Now that the eigenspace $W$ containing $v$ is $\rho$-invariant, it must be a subrepresentation, and by irreducibility condition we have $W=V$, that is, $L=\lambda I$.
- Given $(\rho,\mathbb C^a),(\pi,\mathbb C^b)$ inequivalent irreducible representations of finite $G$, denote $\rho_{st},\pi_{ij}$ their entry-wise restriction, then $$\braket{\rho_{st},\pi_{ij}}=\sum_{g\in G}\rho_{st}(g)\overline{\pi_{ij}(g)}=0,\quad\forall i,j,s,t$$**Proof**: take $M\in\mathcal L(\mathbb C^b,\mathbb C^a)$, and define $$N=\sum_{g\in G}\rho(g)M\pi(g^{-1})$$Now for any $h\in G$ we consider re-index manipulation (similar to that in dual [[Group]]) $$\begin{align}\rho(h)N&=\rho(h)\sum_{g\in G}\rho(g)M\pi(g^{-1})\\&=\sum_{g\in G}\rho(hg)M\pi(g^{-1})&\text{since }\rho\text{ is a homomorphism}\\&=\sum_{g\in G}\rho(hg)M\pi(g^{-1}h^{-1}h)\\&=\left(\sum_{g\in G}\rho(hg)M\pi((hg)^{-1})\right)\pi(h)&\text{since }\pi\text{ is a homomorphism}\\&=N\pi(h)&\text{since }hG\text{ is a permutation of }G\end{align}$$Hence $N$ is a $G$-linear map between $\rho,\pi$, and by the Schur's orthogonality lemma we have $N$ being 0 map (it can't be an isomorphism since $\rho,\pi$ are assumed to be inequivalent). Now by choosing $M$ to be $E_{ij}$ for filtering we completes the proof.
	- Given $(\rho,\mathbb C^a)$ irreducible, we have $$\braket{\rho_{st},\rho_{ij}}\neq0\quad\iff\quad (s,t)=(i,j)$$**Proof**: we repeat the above reasoning to deduce that $N$ is $G$-linear w.r.t $\rho$, hence by the corollary of Schur's orthogonality lemma we have $N=\lambda I,\lambda\in\mathbb C$. By [[Matrix]] we have $$|G|\tr M=\tr(\lambda I)=\lambda\dim\rho$$by taking $M=E_{ij}$ as before we can easily deduce the desired results.
## Dual group
For a [[Group]] $G$, we define its **dual** $G^\vee$ as the set of all irreducible representations. 
- **Dual of abelian group**: given $G$ abelian every $\rho(g)$ is $G$-linear, hence any subspace of $V$ is $G$-invariant. This implies that any irreducible representation must be one-dimensional, i.e., must be characters. [[Group]] 
- **Dimension relation**: we have that $$\sum_{\rho\in G^\vee}(\dim\rho)^2=|G|$$
