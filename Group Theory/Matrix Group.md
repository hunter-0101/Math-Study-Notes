A [[Matrix]] group is a [[Group]] consisting of invertible matrices over a specific field with matrix multiplication as the group operation. 
## General linear group
The **general linear group** of dimension $n$ over [[Field]] $F$ is defined as $$\gl(n,F)=\set{A\in F^{n\times n}:\det A\neq0}$$that is, it consists of all invertible matrices. 
- **GL of $\mathbb F_p$**: The **order** of $\gl(n,\mathbb{F}_p)$ (for finite fields $\mathbb{F}_p$) is $$|GL(n,\mathbb{F}_p)| = (p^n - 1)(p^n - p) \cdots (p^n - p^{n-1})$$One of the Sylow p-subgroups is the upper triangular matrices $P_U$ with $1$s along the diagonal (with order $p^{n(n-1)/2}$), thus by Sylow's theorems $$n_p(\gl(n,\mathbb F_p))=|G:N_G(P_U)|=|\gl(n,\mathbb F_p)|/(p^\frac{n(n-1)}{2}(p-1)^n)=\prod_{k=1}^n\frac{p^k-1}{p-1}$$which uses the fact that upper triangular matrices are closed under multiplication.
- **Density**: $\gl(n,\mathbb R)$ is dense in $M_n(\mathbb R)$, which can be shown by perturbation in diagonal entries or other methods. Further since $\det$ is continuous, we know that the set of singular matrices is closed, which means it must be nowhere dense.
- **Manifold structure**: $\mathbb R^{n\times n}$ is a trivial [[Smooth Manifold]], and since $\gl(n,\mathbb R)=\det^{-1}(\mathbb R^\times)$ by continuity of [[Determinant]] we know that $\gl(n,\mathbb R)$, being an open subset of a smooth manifold, is itself a smooth manifold with the same atlas inherited from $\mathbb R^{n\times n}$.
## Special linear group
The **special linear group** of dimension $n$ over field $F$ is defined as $$\sl(n,F)=\set{A\in \gl(n,F):\det(A)=1}$$This is a group by multiplicity of [[Determinant]]. 
- **$\sl(b,F)$ as a normal subgroup**: we have $\sl(n,F)\triangleleft \gl(n,F)$, and further the quotient is $$\gl(n,F)/\sl(n,F)\cong F^\times$$This follows easily from multilinearity of [[Determinant]]. 
- **Generator**: for $1\le i\neq j\le n$ let $$E_{ij}(\lambda)=(e_{kl})\quad\text{where}\quad e_{kl}=\begin{cases}1,&k=l\\\lambda,&(k,l)=(i,j)\\0,&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$then we have $\sl(n,F)=\braket{E_{ij}(\lambda):1\le i\neq j\le n,\lambda\in F}$. We can first diagonalize a matrix by Gaussian elimination, and then for $a,b\neq1$ consider $$\begin{bmatrix}a\\&b\end{bmatrix}\xto{r_2+a^{-1}r_1}\begin{bmatrix}a\\1&b\end{bmatrix}\xto{c_2-(b-1)c_1}\begin{bmatrix}a&-a(b-1)\\1&1\end{bmatrix}\xto{r_1+a(b-a)r_2}\begin{bmatrix}ab\\1&1\end{bmatrix}\xto{c_1-c_2}\begin{bmatrix}ab\\&1\end{bmatrix}$$in this way we can gradually normalize a diagonal matrix into the identity matrix.
- **Special unitary group**: we define the special unitary group as $$\su(n,F)=\set{A\in \sl(n,F):AA^*=I}$$obviously we have the inclusion $$\su(n,F)\subset\text{U}(n,F)\subset\gl(n,F)$$where $\text{U}(n,F)$ consists of all unitary matrices.
