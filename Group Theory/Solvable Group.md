A group $G$ is said to be **solvable** if one of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:
1. $G$ can be constructed from abelian groups using extensions. [[Group]]
2. The derived series terminates in $\set{1}$.
3. $G$ has a subnormal series whose factor groups are abelian and terminates in $\set{1}$.
	- This definition is equivalent to 2 as $G/N$ is abelian iff $[G,G]\subset N$.
4. (For finite $G$) $G$ has a composition series where the factor groups are cyclic groups of prime order.
	- The equivalence can be seen from two facts:
	  1. Finite group has finite composition length.
	  2. Every simple abelian group is cyclic of prime order.
## Derived series
**Derived (Commutator) series** is the following series of commutator subgroups $$G=G^{(0)}\triangleright G^{(1)}\triangleright G^{(2)}\triangleright\cdots$$where $G^{(n+1)}=[G^{(n)},G^{(n)}]$. It may ends with invariant $G^{(t)}$ or $1$, and in later case $G$ is said to be solvable, and the least $n$ such that $G^{(n)}=1$ is the **derived (solvable) length**.
- **Commutator subgroup**: $G^{(1)}=[G,G]=\langle[a,b]=a^{-1}b^{-1}ab|a,b\in G\rangle$ is the group generated by all commutators. (Note that product of commutators is not necessarily a commutator)
	- $G/N$ is abelian iff $[G,G]\subset N$. Note that $[G,G]\triangleleft G$ since for $u=[a,b]$, we have $g^{-1}ug=u[u,g]$.
- For finite non-solvable group, the terminated subgroup $G^{(n)}$, which satisfies $[G^{(n)},G^{(n)}]=G^{(n)}$ is called **perfect group**. For infinite group, the series need not to terminate at a finite stage.
## Composition series
A composition series for a group $G$ is a finite subnormal series of subgroups $$G = G_0 \triangleright G_1 \triangleright \cdots \triangleright G_n = {e}$$where the quotient $G_{i-1}/G_i$ is simple, i.e. $G_i$ is the maximal normal subgroup of $G_{i-1}$. The quotients are called **composition factors**.
- A subnormal series is composition series iff it is of maximal length, i.e., no additional subgroup can be inserted into the series. $n$ is called the **composition length**.
- **Jordan-Hölder theorem**: let $G$ be a finite group with more than one element, then $G$ has a composition series, and the composition factors in a composition series are unique up to isomorphism and permutation.
	- **Proof 1**: the main idea is to use induction on the length of shortest composition series. It is sufficient to show that any decomposition seres is equivalent to the minimal seres.
	  0. **Lemma**: if $A,B$ are normal subgroups of $G$ such that $G/A,G/B$ are simple, then $$G/A\cong B/(A\cap B),\quad G/B\cong A/(A\cap B)$$This can be proven in the following steps: 
	     1. $A,B$ does not contain each other, otherwise $G/A$ or $G/B$ will not be simple.
	     2. $AB/A$ is normal in $G/A$, and by simplicity we know that $AB/A=G/A$.
	     3. The fourth isomorphism theorem yields the result. [[Group Homomorphism]]
	 1. **Existence & preparation**: by the fourth isomorphism theorem a composition series terminating in $1$ is guaranteed to exist for finite group $G$. Pick below the shortest among them: $$G=G_0\triangleright G_1\triangleright\cdots\triangleright G_r=1$$For any other composition series denoted with $H_i(0\le i\le s)$, if $H_1=G_1$ then by induction the result holds. Otherwise let $K=H_1\cap G_1\triangleleft G$. By the lemma we have that $G_1/K\cong G/H_1$ and $H_1/K\cong G/G_1$ are simple.
	 2. **Construct a series $K_i$**: let $K_i=K\cap G_i$, then $K_i\triangleleft G_i,K_{i+1}\triangleleft K_i$. Consider the homomorphism $\phi:K\to G_i/G_{i+1}$ given by the quotient map, then $\ker\phi=K_i$ and the image is normal. By the isomorphism theorems $K_i/K_{i+1}\triangleleft G_i/G_{i+1}$, thus by its simplicity we have $K_i/K_{i+1}$ either trivial or simple. By removing the duplicates we have $$\begin{align}G_1\triangleright G_2\triangleright\cdots\triangleright G_r=1\\G_1\triangleright K_1\triangleright\cdots\triangleright K_r=1\end{align}$$By induction the above two series are equivalent, thus exactly one of $K_i/K_{i+1}$ is trivial.
	 3. **Relate to $H_i$**: as $K_1\triangleleft H_1$ with simple quotient, we have two composition series $$\begin{align}H_1\triangleright H_2\triangleright\cdots\triangleright H_s=1\\H_1\triangleright K_1\triangleright\cdots\triangleright K_r=1\end{align}$$Again by induction these two series are equivalent with $r-1=s-1$. Thus we only need to show that $$\begin{align}G\triangleright G_1\triangleright K_1\triangleright\cdots\triangleright K_r=1\\G\triangleright H_1\triangleright K_1\triangleright\cdots\triangleright K_r=1\end{align}$$are equivalent. By lemma above we have $G/G_1\cong H_1/K_1$ and $G/H_1\cong G_1/K_1$, thus the proof is completed.
	 - **Proof 2**: we use induction on $|G|$. Most steps are similar to that in proof 1, only that after defining $K_2$, we directly pick a composition series of it. Now by the lemma we have the vertices marked by the same symbol isomorphic, thus the result directly follows. ![[Pasted image 20241214202715.png]]
	 - **Composition series for infinite group**: for infinite groups with a composition series, the Jordan-Hölder theorem still holds, but in the proof we need to also show that the normal subgroup of a group with finite composition series also has a finite composition series (as we've done in proof 1).
- Any finite group has a composition series, as if $G/N$ is not simple, we can always extent $N$ to some larger normal subgroup with the fourth isomorphism theorem. However infinite groups do not necessarily have a composition series, like $Z$.
> [!info] Composition series and Derived series
> Composition series breaks down a group into **==irreducible components==** (simple groups). This helps to investigate the properties of $G$, as we can look into each building block separately and combine them together through group extension ([[Group#Group extension]]).
> Derived series breaks down a group into **==abelian components==**. It measures how "far" $G$ is from being abelian by gradually "peeling off" commutators.
## Property of solvable group
- **Subgroup of solvable group is solvable**: for any $H\le G$, it can be shown that $H\cap G_i$ forms a composition series for $H$.
- **Extension of solvable groups is solvable**: for $N\triangleleft G$ and $\overline G=G/H$, we have that if $N,\overline G$ are solvable, then $G$ is solvable. This can be shown by directly constructing the composition series.
	- **Finite p-groups are solvable**: we use induction on order of p-group $P$. We already know that $Z(P)$ is not trivial, and by induction hypothesis $Z(P)$ and $P/Z(P)$ are solvable, thus by the above property $P$ is also solvable. [[Group Gallery#$p$-group]]
## Nilpotent group
A group $G$ is called **nilpotent** if it satisfies one of the following **equivalent** conditions:
1. $G$ has a central series of finite length.
2. $G$ has a upper/lower central series that terminates with trivial subgroup.
3. $G$ can be obtained from abelian groups by successive central extensions. Here central extension refer to those where the image of the normal subgroup $N$ is central in $G$. (Note that this poses a stronger constraint to the extension, thus **all nilpotent groups are solvable**)
4. (Finite) $G$ is equal to a direct product of its Sylow subgroups.
	- This can be shown by the fact that a). p-groups are nilpotent. b). A group is equal to the direct product of its Sylow subgroups if $n_p=1$ for all primes $p\mid |G|$. [[Sylow Theorems]]
### Central series
A **central series** is a kind of normal series of subgroups. For $G$, the central series is defined as $$G=G_0\triangleright G_1\triangleright\cdots\triangleright G_n=1$$where each quotients are central in $G/G_{i+1}$: $[G,G_i]\le G_{i+1}$.
- A group has a central series iff it's nilpotent.
- **Ascending central series**: denote $Z^2(G)=Z(G/Z(G))$ and similarly define $Z^i(G)$, then we have a series $$1\le Z(G)\le Z^2(G)\le\cdots$$where $g\in Z^i(G)$ iff $[g,x]\in Z^{i-1}(G),\forall x\in G$. The smallest $n$ such that $Z^n(G)=G$ is called the **nilpotency class** of $G$.
	- We sometimes refer to groups of class $2$ as metabelian.
