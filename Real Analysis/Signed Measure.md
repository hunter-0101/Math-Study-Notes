A **signed measure** is a function $\nu:\Sigma\to\mathbb R\cup\set{\infty,-\infty}$ s.t. $\nu(\varnothing)=0$ and is disjoint $\sigma$-additive. Note that at most one of $\infty,-\infty$ is allowed to be taken to avoid the undefined $\infty-\infty$. The collection of all signed regular ([[Measure]]) Borel measure on a domain $X$ is denoted $M(X)$.
- **Distribution function of signed measure**: for signed Borel measure $\nu$ define $$F_\nu(x)=\begin{cases}\nu((0,x]),&x>0\\0,&x=0\\\nu((x,0]),&x<0\end{cases}$$Note however nothing more can be said about $F$ without extra conditions., e.g., $\nu=\delta_1-\delta_2$. Conversely given $F$ right-continuous we cannot in general say that $F$ determines a signed measure, e.g., $x\sin (1/x)$.
	- **Discussion**: the relation between signed measure and its distribution function is much more complex mainly because $F$ is not monotonic, which makes it possible to exhibit some pathological behaviors.
- **Total variation**: define the variation of $\nu$ on $E$ as $$|\nu|(E)=\sup\Set{\sum_{n=1}^\infty\left|\nu(E_n)\right|:E=\bigcup E_n,E_n\cap E_m=\varnothing}$$and its total variation as $\|\nu\|=|\nu|(X)$. It's easy to show that $|\nu|$ itself is a (positive) measure with $-|\nu|\le\nu\le|\nu|$. We define $\nu$ to be $\sigma$-finite if $|\nu|$ is $\sigma$-finite.
	- **Positive/Negative variation**: define $$\nu^+=\frac{1}{2}(|\nu|+\nu),\quad\nu^-=\frac{1}{2}(|\nu|-\nu)$$then both are positive measures with $\nu=\nu^+-\nu^-,|\nu|=\nu^++\nu^-$.
	- **Distribution function**: given $\sigma$-finite signed measure $\nu$ we have $F_\nu\in\bv(E)$ for any compact $E$. Conversely given $F\in\bv(I)$ for any finite interval $I\subset\mathbb R$ we have a unique $\sigma$-finite measure induced by $F$. The proof is similar to [[Measure]], via Jordan decomposition of $F$ ([[Lebesgue Differentiability]]). 
- **Mutual singularity**: $\nu,\mu$ on $(X,\Sigma)$ are mutually singular if there exists disjoint $A,B$ s.t. $$\nu(E)=\nu(A\cap E),\quad\mu(E)=\mu(B\cap E),\quad\forall E\in\Sigma$$i.e., $\nu,\mu$ are supported on disjoint sets. We denote this relation as $\nu\perp\mu$.
- **Absolute continuity**: $\nu$ is said to be AC w.r.t $\mu$, denoted $\nu\ll\mu$, if $$\mu(E)=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\mu(E)=0,\quad\forall E\in\Sigma$$i.e., if $\supp\nu$ is an essential part of $\supp\mu$. 
	- **Relation with AC in [[Lebesgue Measure]]**: the AC in Lebesgue setting can restated as $$P:\text{For each }\varepsilon>0\text{ there exists a }\delta>0\text{ s.t. }\mu(E)<\delta\Rightarrow|\nu(E)|<\varepsilon$$If we define $\nu(E)=\int_E fd\mu$, then $P\Rightarrow\mu\gg\nu$, and when $|\nu|$ is finite $\mu\gg\nu\Rightarrow P$.
- **Hahn decomposition theorem**: if $\mu$ is a signed measure of the space $(X,M)$, then there exists a positive set $P$ and a negative set $N$ such that $P\cup N=X,P\cap N=\varnothing$. If  $P',N'$ is another such pair, then $P\Delta P'(=N\Delta N')$ is null for $\mu$. We call it a **Hahn decomposition** for $\mu$.
	- **Proof**: WLOG assume $\mu$ does not assume $-\infty$ (otherwise consider $-\mu$), and let $$m=\sup_{E\text{ positive}}\mu(E)$$then there is a sequence $P_n$ whose measure tends to $m$. Let $P=\bigcup P_n$, then $\mu(P)=m$. Let $N=X\backslash P$ and it can be shown that $N$ is negative. Also we can show that $P\Delta P'$ is both positive and negative, thus null.
## Lebesgue decomposition theorem
**Theorem**: let $\nu,\mu$ be $\sigma$-finite signed measure on $(X,\Sigma)$. There exist two uniquely determined $\sigma$-finite signed measures $\nu_0,\nu_1$ on $(X,\Sigma)$ such that $$\nu=\nu_a+\nu_s,\quad\nu_a\ll\mu,\quad\nu_s\perp\mu$$Moreover, there is an extended $\mu$-integrable function $f:X\to\mathbb R$ such that $d\nu_a=fd\mu$, and any two such functions are equal $a.e. [\mu]$. Locally we write $d\nu=fd\mu+d\nu_s$.
**Proof**: first assume $\nu,\mu$ are both positive and finite. Let $\rho=\nu+\mu$, and define a transform $$\ell(\psi)=\int_X\psi d\nu$$Then $\ell\in\mathcal B(L^2(X,\rho))$ by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality ([[Lp Space]]), hence by Riesz representation theorem ([[Dual Space]]) there exists $g\in L^2(X,\rho)$ s.t. $$\int_X\psi d\nu=\int_X\psi gd\rho,\quad\forall\psi\in L^2(X,\rho)$$Since $0\le g\le 1\ae[\rho]$ by taking $\psi=\chi_E,\forall E\in\Sigma$, we can substitute $\rho=\mu+\nu$ into the identity to get $\int\psi(1-g)d\nu=\int\psi gd\mu$. Now consider $$\begin{align}&A=\set{x\in X:0\le g<1},&\nu_a(E)=\nu(A\cap E)\\& B=\set{x\in X:g=1},&\nu_s(E)=\nu(B\cap E)\end{align}$$Obviously $\nu_s\perp\mu,\nu_a\ll\mu$. To find $f$ we take $\psi=\chi_E(1+g+\cdots+g^n)$, yielding $$\int_E(1-g^{n+1})d\nu=\int_Eg(1+\cdots+g^n)d\mu$$Take $n\to\infty$ on both sides, then by definition we get $$\nu_a(E)=\int_E\frac{g}{1-g}d\mu\quad\Longrightarrow\quad d\nu=\frac{g}{1-g}d\mu$$For $\sigma$-finite positive measures $\mu,\nu$ we can take a separation $X=\bigcup E_i$ on each of which $\mu,\nu$ are finite, and then sum them up. Finally for signed measure we only need to separate the positive and negative parts and apply the above results respectively. The uniqueness of decomposition follows from the fact that $\nu\ll\mu,\nu\perp\mu$ implies $\nu=0$.
- **Radon-Nikodym theorem**: when $\nu\ll\mu$ the theorem yields $d\nu=fd\mu$ for some $f$, which is usually referred to as the **Radon-Nikodym derivative** of $\nu$ with respect to $\mu$: $$d\nu=\frac{d\nu}{d\mu}d\mu=fd\mu\quad\iff\quad\nu(E)=\int fd\mu,\forall E$$To put simply, it describes the "**rate of change of density**" of one measure w.r.t another.
- Consider $(X,\Sigma)=(\mathbb R^n,\mathcal B(\mathbb R^n))$ and let $m$ denote the Lebesgue measure. Consider the limit$$F(x)=\lim_{r\to0}\frac{\nu(B(r,x))}{m(B(r,x))}$$When $\nu\ll m\Rightarrow d\nu=fdm$, then the above limit is simply the average value of $f$ on $B(r,x)$, so we would expect that $F\overset{a.e.}{=}f$. This may be regarded as a generalization of the FTC: derivative of the indefinite integral of $f$ is $f$. [[Riemann Integral]]
- **Decomposition of Borel measure**: for any regular Borel measure $\nu$ we have decomposition $$\nu=\nu_{ac}+\nu_{sc}+\nu_{pp}$$where three are respectively **absolutely continuous** ($\nu_{ac}\ll\nu$), **singular continuous** ($\nu_{sc}\perp\nu$), and **pure point** ($\nu_{pp}$ is a discrete measure).
- **Historical note**: the theorem was first proved by Lebesgue on $\mathbb R$, and then generalized by Radon and Nikodym. Later on it was further refined along different directions, and there have been many different proofs for it.
## Complex measure
Given $(X,\Sigma)$, a **complex measure** is a function $\mu:\Sigma\to\mathbb C$ satisfying disjoint $\sigma$-additivity.
- **Total variation**: $|\mu|$ is defined exactly the same as signed measure. $|\mu|$ is obviously a [[Measure]], and moreover we always have $|\mu|(X)<\infty$.
