For $E\subset\mathbb R^d$ its **outer $\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff measure** is defined as $$H_\alpha^*(E)=\lim_{\delta\to0}\inf\Set{\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}(\diam F_n)^\alpha:E\subset\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}F_n,\diam F_n\le\delta,\forall n}$$We denote the infimum term as $H_\alpha^\delta$, which increases as $\delta$ decreases. The $(\diam F_n)^\alpha$ term captures the key idea of using the scaling property to reflect dimension.
- **Qualification as outer measure**: obviously $H_\alpha^*$ is monotonic and sub-additive. It's also a metric outer measure for the same reason as [[Lebesgue Measure]]. By [[Measure]] we can restrict it to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal B(X)$ and get the **$\alpha$-dimensional Hausdorff measure**.
	- **Disjoint $\sigma$-additivity**: by [[Measure]] $H_\alpha$ is disjoint-$\sigma$-additive. 
	- **Translation & rotation**: we have $H_\alpha(E+h)=H_\alpha(E)$ and $H_\alpha(rE)=H_\alpha(E)$, by invariance of $\diam E$ under two transforms.
	- **Dilation**: $H_\alpha(\delta E)=\delta^\alpha H_\alpha(E)$.
- **Relation with [[Lebesgue Measure]]**: for $E\in\mathcal B(\mathbb R^d)$ we have $$c_d H_d(E)=\lambda(E)\quad\text{where}\quad c_d=\frac{\lambda(B)}{(\diam B)^d}=\frac{v_d}{2^d}$$The proof for $\le$ is standard by the fact that Lebesgue measure can be constructed on balls (or any set of bounded eccentricity ([[Lebesgue Measure]])), while for $\ge$
## Hausdorff dimension
Notice that given $E\in\mathcal B(\mathbb R^d),0<\alpha<\beta$, we have $$H_\alpha^*(E)<\infty\Rightarrow H_\beta^*(E)=0,\quad H_\beta^*(E)>0\Rightarrow H_\alpha^*(E)=\infty$$From this we deduce that there is a unique $\alpha>0$ s.t. $H_\beta(E)=0,\forall\beta<\alpha$ and $H_\beta(E)=\infty,\forall\beta>\alpha$. In other words, we have $$\alpha=\sup\set{\beta:H_\beta(E)=\infty}=\inf\set{\beta: H_\beta(E)=0}$$In such case we say that $E$ has **Hausdorff dimension** $\alpha$, denoted $\dim E=\alpha$. For this $\alpha$ we only know in general that $0\le H_\alpha(E)\le\infty$, and if the inequalities are strict we say that $E$ has **strict Hausdorff dimension** $\alpha$.
- **Cantor set ([[Special Function Gallery]])**: we have $\dim\mathcal C=\alpha=\ln 2/\ln 3$.
  **Proof**: by definition $\mathcal C=\bigcap C_n$ where $C_n$ consists of $2^n$ intervals of length $3^{-n}$. For any $\delta>0$ we take $n$ large enough s.t. $3^{-n}<\delta$, then $$H_\alpha^\delta(\mathcal C)\le H_\alpha^\delta(C_n)\le2^n(3^{-n})^\alpha=1$$For the reverse, notice that for any $f$ that is $\gamma$-Hölder continuous with coefficient $M$ we have $$H_\beta(f(E))\le M^\beta H_\alpha(E),\quad\forall\alpha=\beta\gamma,E\text{ compact}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\dim f(E)\le\frac{1}{\gamma}\dim E$$Since the Cantor-Lebesgue function $c(x)$ is $\ln2/\ln3$-Hölder continuous with $\im c=[0,1]$, we get $H_1([0,1])\le M^\beta H_\alpha(\mathcal C)$, hence $H_\alpha(\mathcal C)>0$. The above results show that $\dim\mathcal C=\alpha$.
