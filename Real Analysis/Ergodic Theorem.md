Ergodic theory, based on [[Measure]] theory, mainly study the statistical properties of an deterministic dynamical system. Below we base our discussion on a $\sigma$-finite measure space $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$.
- **Measure-preserving transform**: measurable $\tau:X\to X$ is said to preserve measure if $$\mu(\tau^{-1}(E))=\mu(E),\quad E\in\Sigma$$if $\tau$ is a bijection then it's further called a measure-preserving isomorphism.
	- **Intuition**: the above definition is basically saying that, given any $E\in\Sigma$, its trajectory along $\tau$, i.e. $\tau(E)$, has the same measure as $E$. We use $\tau^{-1}(E)$ rather than $\tau(E)$ mainly for two reasons: it fits into the definition of measurable function (in particular push-forward map), and also ensures that all sets under discussion are measurable.
	- **Invariance of integral**: for any measurable $f$ we have $f\circ\tau(x)$ measurable, and $$\int f\circ\tau d\mu=\int fd\mu$$This can be verified using the standard mechanism.
## Mean ergodic theorem
Take $\mathcal H=L^2(X,\Sigma,\mu)$, and define $T:f\mapsto f\circ\tau$. By invariance of integral $T$ is an isometry. Below we denote $S$ the eigenspace of $\lambda=1$, which is obviously closed.
**Mean ergodic theorem**: for $T\in\mathcal L(\mathcal H)$ an isometry and $P$ the projection onto $S$. Let $$A_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}T^k$$then $A_nf\to Pf$ in norm for all $f\in\mathcal H$.
**Proof**: denote $S_*=\set{f:T^*f=f},S_1=\im(I-T)$, then it's obvious that $S_*=S,\overline{S_1}^\perp=S$. Now we write $f=f_0+f_1$ where $f_0\in S,f_1\in\overline{S_1}$, and pick $f_1'\in S_1$ s.t. $\|f_1-f_1'\|<\varepsilon$, then $$A_n f_0=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}T^kf_0=f_0=Pf,\quad A_nf_1'=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}T^k(I-T)g=\frac{1}{n}(g-T^ng)\to0$$and $\|A_n(f_1-f_1')\|\le\frac{1}{n}\sum\|T^k(f_1-f_1')\|\le\|f_1-f_1'\|<\varepsilon$. Hence $\sup_{n\to\infty}\|A_nf-Pf\|\le\varepsilon$.
## Maximal ergodic theorem
Define the maximal function as $$f^*(x)=\sup_{1\le m<\infty}\frac{1}{m}\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}|f\circ\tau^k(x)|$$
**Maximal ergodic theorem**: whenever $f\in L^1(X,\mu)$ we have $f^*<\infty,\ae$ with a constant $A$ s.t. $$\mu(\set{f^*>\alpha})\le\frac{A}{\alpha}\|f\|_1$$**Proof**: first consider $f\in L^1(\mathbb Z)$. Extend it to $\tilde f(x)=f([x])$, then it can be verified that $f^*\le2{\tilde f}^*$ where RHS is the H-L maximal function defined in [[Lebesgue Differentiability]]. Properties of H-L maximal function yields the desired result.
