**Remark**: the [note](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/03/30/245c-notes-1-interpolation-of-lp-spaces/#more-1977) by Terry Tao seems to have a deep and comprehensive coverage of this topic.

**Riesz interpolation theorem**: given $1\le p_0,p_1,q_0,q_1\le\infty$ and $T:L^{p_0}+L^{p_1}\to L^{q_0}+L^{q_1}$, if $$\|T\|_{p_0\to q_0}\le M_0,\quad\|T\|_{p_1\to q_1}\le M_1$$then for any pair of indexes $p,q$ with $$\frac{1}{p}=\frac{1-t}{p_0}+\frac{t}{p_1},\quad\frac{1}{q}=\frac{1-t}{q_0}+\frac{t}{q_1},\quad t\in[0,1]$$we have $\|T\|_{p\to q}\le M$ where $M\le M_0^{1-t}M_1^t$.
**Proof**: we start with simple function $f$ with $\|f\|_p=1$. By the equality condition of Hölder's inequality ([[Lp Space]]) it suffices to show that $$\left|\int(Tf)gd\mu\right|\le M\|Tf\|_q\|g\|_{q^*},\quad\forall \|g\|_{q^*}=1,\frac{1}{q}+\frac{1}{q^*}=1$$Assume that $p<\infty,q>1$, and let $$f_z=|f|^{\gamma(z)}\frac{f}{|f|},\quad\gamma(z)=p\left(\frac{1-z}{p_0}+\frac{z}{p_1}\right);\quad g_z=|g|^{\delta(z)}\frac{g}{|g|},\quad\delta(z)=q^*\left(\frac{1-z}{q_0^*}+\frac{z}{q_1^*}\right)$$Notice that $f_t=f$, with $\|f_z\|_{p_0}=1,\forall\Re z=0$ and $\|f_z\|_{q_1}=1,\forall\Re z=1$, and similarly for $g_z$. Let $$\Phi(z)=\int(Tf_z)g_zd\mu$$by the assumption that $f,g$ are simple we can verify directly that $\Phi\in\mathcal O(S)$ and verifies the conditions in the three-lines lemma, hence the result follows. For general $f$ by density of simple functions it suffices to show that $Tf_n\xto\ae Tf$ if $f_n\xto{L^p} f$, which can be done by convergence acceleration ([[Subsequence Acceleration]]). Finally for $p=\infty$ the result follows directly from Hölder's inequality, while for $q=1$ we take $g_z=g,\forall z\in S$ and argue as in $q>1$. 
- **Hadamard three-lines lemma**: given $\Phi(z)\in\mathcal O(S)\cap C_b(\overline S)$ ([[Holomorphic Function]]) where $S=\set{a<\Re z<b}$ for some $a,b\in\mathbb R$, denote $$M(x)=\sup_{y\in\mathbb R}|\Phi(x+iy)|,\quad\forall x\in[a,b]$$then $M(x)$ is log convex ([[Convexity]]) on $[0,1]$.
  **Proof**: define the regularized function $$\tilde\Phi(z)=\Phi(z)M(a)^{\frac{z-b}{b-a}}M(b)^{-\frac{z-a}{b-a}}$$then by definition of $M$ we have $$|\tilde\Phi(z)|\le1,\quad\forall z\in\partial S$$hence naturally it suffices to show that the inequality also holds within $S$. To this end, via an affine transformation ([[Euclidean Space]]) we can assume WLOG that $a=0,b=1$, and define $$\tilde\Phi_n(z)=\tilde\Phi(z)\exp\left(\frac{z^2-1}{n}\right)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\lim_{z\in S,|z|\to\infty}\left|\tilde\Phi_n(z)\right|=0,\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$$hence by maximum modulus principle ([[Complex Geometry]]) we know that $\tilde\Phi_n(z)\le1,\forall z\in S$, and now by taking $n\to\infty$ with pointwise convergence we know ([[Series]]) that the desired inequality holds for all $z\in S$, which completes the proof. 
	- **Intuition**: it's more natural to go the other way around. We could start with $$\Phi\in\mathcal O(S)\quad\text{s.t.}\quad\lim_{z\in S,|z|\to\infty}|\Phi(z)|=0,\quad M(0)=M(1)=1$$and notice that the maximum modulus principle can be applied to conclude the desired result, and then try to reduce the general case via exponential modulus regularization. This is essentially the [[Domain-Range Regularization]]. 
	- **Construction of $\tilde\Phi_n$**: it's no doubt natural to regularize the modulus of a holomorphic function via exponential function, and for pointwise convergence we necessarily need an $\frac{1}{n}$ in the construction. For the numerator, by [[Exponential Function]] we hope that $$\lim_{z\in S,|z|\to\infty}\left|\exp(f(z))\right|=0\quad\iff\quad\lim_{z\in S,|z|\to\infty}\Im f(z)=-\infty $$hence the easiest way is to take $f(z)=z^2-1$, since $$f(S)=\Set{z=x+iy\in\mathbb C:x\le-\frac{y^2}{4}+1}$$here the extra $-1$ is used to ensure that $\Im f(z)<0$, so that the multiplication results in a decreasing in modulus. 
- **Riesz convexity theorem**: define the **Riesz diagram** of $T$ a subset of $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ consisting all points $(x,y)$ s.t. $T\in\mathcal B(L^p,L^q)$ where $x=1/p,y=1/q$. Denote $M_{x,y}$ the optimal coefficient, then by Riesz interpolation theorem we know that the Riesz diagram of $T$ is a convex set, and $\ln M_{x,y}$ is a convex function on the set.
## Application
- **Hausdorff-Young inequality**: denote $a_n$ the [[Fourier Series]] coefficient of $f$ on $[0,2\pi]$, then $$\left(\sum|a_n|^q\right)^{1/q}\le\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}|f(\theta)|^p\right)^{1/p},\quad \left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}|f(\theta)|^q\right)^{1/q}\le\left(\sum|a_n|^p\right)^{1/p}$$both valid for $1\le p\le2,1/p+1/q=1$. The case $p=q=2$ is exactly the Parseval's identity, while $p=1,q=\infty$ or $p=\infty,q=1$ are easily verified.
	- **Fourier transform analogy**: by Riesz interpolation theorem applied on [[FT on L1]] and [[FT on L2]] we know that $\mathcal F$ has a unique extension to $\mathcal F\in\mathcal B(L^p,L^q)$ where $p,q$ are described above, with $\|\mathcal Ff\|_q\le\|f\|_p$.
- **Young's convolution inequality**: the result described in [[Lp Space]] can also be proved in the following fashion: fix $g$ and let $Tf=f*g$, then Young's inequality ([[Convolution]]) implies that $\|Tf\|_r\le M\|f\|_1$ where $M=\|g\|_r$, while Hölder's inequality implies $\|Tf\|_\infty\le M\|f\|_{r^*}$, hence RIT yields the result.
