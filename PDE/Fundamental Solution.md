Under [[Distribution]] framework, the **fundamental solution** of a linear partial differential operator ([[Linear PDE]]) $L$ is defined as the [[Weak Solution]] of the **fundamental equation** $$LF=\delta$$where $\delta$ is the Dirac delta function ([[Special Function Gallery]]). 
- **Malgrange-Ehrenpreis theorem**: every non-zero linear partial differential operator $L(D)$ with constant coefficients possesses a fundamental solution $F \in \mathcal{D}^*(\mathbb{R}^n)$ ([[Distribution]]).
- **Non-uniqueness**: $F$ is not unique, since by superposition we have $$\begin{cases}LF = \delta\\Lh=0\end{cases}\imply L(F+h)=0$$Uniqueness is typically recovered by imposing decay conditions at infinity (e.g., the radiation condition for Helmholtz).
- **Regularity:** the smoothness of $F$ away from the singularity at the origin is determined by the ellipticity of $L$. For elliptic operators, $F \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{0\})$.
## Application
- **Solving PDE**: the solution of a general PDE can be calculated by taking the [[Convolution]] between the fundamental solution and the inhomogeneous term: $$Lu=f\qiffq u=F*f$$**Proof**: under distribution-theoretic framework we have $$L(F*f)=(LF)*f=\delta*f=f$$which follows directly from properties of convolution and distribution, hence $F*f$ is exactly a solution to the original equation. 
- **Method of fundamental solution**: MFS is a meshless numerical method that approximates the solution $u$ as a linear combination of fundamental solutions shifted to "source points" $y_j$ located outside the domain $\Omega$.
	1. **Source point specification**: place $N$ source points $\{y_j\}_{j=1}^N\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \overline{\Omega}$.
	2. **Construct the approximation**: represent the approximate solution as: $$u_h(x) = \sum_{j=1}^N \alpha_j F(x - y_j)$$
	3. **Coefficient calculation**: determine coefficients $\{\alpha_j\}$ by satisfying boundary conditions at collocation points $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N \subseteq \partial \Omega$.

## Example
- **[[Green's Function]]**: green's function is a specific type of fundamental solution of a PDE that also takes the IV/BV condition into consideration. 
- **[[Laplace's Equation]]**: we show that the fundamental solution of the 2D Laplace equation is $$F=-\frac{1}{2\pi}\ln|x|$$Denote $L=-\Delta$, and pick a test function $\varphi\in\mathcal D(\Omega)$, then we have $$\braket{F,L^*\varphi}=\int_{\mathbb R^n} F(-\Delta\varphi)dx=\lim_{\varepsilon\searrow0}\int_{\Omega_\varepsilon}-F\Delta\varphi dx\where\Omega_\varepsilon=\Set{\varepsilon\le|x|\le\varepsilon^{-1}}$$Applying Green's identity ([[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) and the property of compact support of $\varphi$ yields $$\braket{F,L^*\varphi}=\lim_{\varphi\searrow0}\int_{|x|=\varepsilon}\paren{F\pard{\varphi}{\nu}-\pard{F}{\nu}\varphi}$$By direct estimation we know that he first term vanishes, while the second term converges to $\varphi(0)$ as $\varphi\searrow0$, therefore the definition of fundamental solution is verified.
