In this note we record some important PDEs, and discuss how they're deduced from other theoretical fields, like physics or chemistry. 
## Important tools
The following tools are quite commonly applied in the deduction of various PDEs. 
- **Gauss-Green theorem**: see [[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]]. This is usually used to simply a rather complicated expression deduced from physical law into a simple one that can be handled properly in math. 
- **Identity theorem for integrable functions**: given $f\in C^1(\overline\Omega)\cap C^2(\Omega)$ and $\varphi\in C_c^\infty(\Omega)$, denote $$\mathcal M=\set{\varphi_{\varepsilon,a,b}:\varphi_{\varepsilon,t}(x)=\varepsilon^{-n}\varphi(\varepsilon^{-1}(x-t)),\varepsilon>0,t\in\mathbb R^n}$$if we're given the integral condition $$\int_\Omega f\varphi_{\varepsilon,t}=0,\quad\forall\varphi_{\varepsilon,t}\in\mathcal M$$then we have $f=0$. The proof is quite easy, and this result is commonly used to deduce the differential equations from an integral equation.
	- **Generalization**: see [[Lebesgue Integral]] for generalization to locally integrable functions. This result is 
## Heat equation
By preservation of energy we have $$\int_Dc\rho\left(u|_{t_2}-u|_{t_1}\right)dx=-\int_{t_1}^{t_1}dt\int_{\partial D}q\cdot ndS+\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\int_D\rho f_0dx$$By Fourier's theorem (from thermodynamics) we have $q=-k\nabla u$, and by substitution we get $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\alpha^2\Delta u=f$$here we used Green's theorem for simplification of the integral equation, and the identity theorem for obtaining the differential form of the equation. This is called the [[Heat Equation]]. 
## Mass equation (continuity equation)
See [[Motion of Fluid]].
## Minimal surface
We consider the area functional for the graph of a function $u:\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$: $$\mathcal{A}(u) = \int_\Omega \sqrt{1+|\nabla u(x)|^2}dx$$Take a smooth perturbation $v \in C_c^\infty(\Omega)$. Define $$u_\varepsilon = u + \varepsilon v, \quad \Phi(\varepsilon) = \mathcal{A}(u_\varepsilon)$$ and compute: $$\frac{d}{d\varepsilon}\Big|_{\varepsilon=0} \Phi(\varepsilon)
= \int_\Omega \frac{\nabla u \cdot \nabla v}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}}dx$$For $u$ to be a critical point, this derivative must vanish for all $v$: $$\int_\Omega \frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}} \cdot \nabla v dx = 0
\quad \forall v \in C_c^\infty(\Omega)$$By definition of distributional divergence: $$\div\left(\frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}}\right) = 0
\quad \text{in } \mathcal{D}'(\Omega)$$This is the **[[Minimal Surface]] equation**.
- **Connection to the Fréchet derivative viewpoint ([[Variational Principle]])**: in above derivation, we fixed one perturbation $v$ and varied the scalar parameter $\varepsilon$. This computed the **directional derivative** of $\mathcal{A}$ at $u$ along $v$. Collecting all such directional derivatives yields the mapping $$D\mathcal{A}(u)[v] = \int_\Omega \frac{\nabla u}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^2}} \cdot \nabla v dx$$This is a **linear functional in $v$**. If this functional is continuous in the topology of $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ (for suitable $p$), then $\mathcal{A}$ is **Fréchet differentiable** and the above expression is the first variation. Thus, the one-parameter method is the *computational face* of the more abstract Banach space differentiation framework. Both lead to the same weak Euler–Lagrange PDE. 
## Variational principle
This is a concrete working example for the general [[Variational Principle]] theory.
Denote $M=C^1(\overline\Omega)$ for some $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, and define $$J(v)=\frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega(|\nabla v|^2+v^2)dx+\frac{1}{2}\int_{\partial\Omega}\alpha(x)v^2ds-\int_\Omega fvdx-\int_{\partial\Omega}gvds$$where $\alpha(x)\ge0$. Show that the following two conditions are equivalent:
1. $u$ is the solution to the problem of variational principle $$J(u)=\min_{v\in M}J(v)$$
2. $u$ has the property that for any $v\in M$ we have $$\int_\Omega(\nabla u\cdot\nabla v+uv-fv)dx+\int_{\partial\Omega}(\alpha(x)uv-gv)ds=0$$
**Solution**: for $1\Rightarrow2$ we only need to define $$j(\varepsilon)=J(u+\varepsilon v),\quad u,v\in M$$and deduce form the Fermat's law ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) to obtain the expression in 2. Conversely in the expression we take $v=w-u$, then the simplified expression allows us to prove that $$J(w)\ge J(u),\quad\forall w\in M$$hence this direction is also valid.
- **Motivation for taking $v=w-u$**: intuitively speaking, if we wanna compare $J(w)$ and $J(u)$ then it makes sense to look at their difference $v=w-u$, and the substitution mentioned above is almost the only condition we can get in the above scenario. More algebraically, we can decompose $J$ into two terms $$J(v)=\frac{1}{2}a(v,v)-\ell(v)\quad\text{where}\quad$$into a symmetric bilinear term and a linear term: $$a(\phi,\psi)=\int_\Omega(\nabla\phi\cdot\nabla\psi+\phi\psi)dx+\int_{\partial\Omega}\alpha\phi\psi dS,\quad\ell(\psi)=\int_\Omega f\psi dx+\int_{\partial\Omega}g\psi dS$$The Euler-Lagrange identity ([[Variational Principle]]) is exactly $$\mathcal E(u,v)=a(u,v)-\ell(v)=0,\quad\forall v\in M$$Now the difference is given by $$\begin{align}J(w)-J(u)&=\frac{1}{2}a(w,w)-\ell(w)-\left(\frac{1}{2}a(u,u)-\ell(u)\right)\\&=\frac{1}{2}a(w-u,w-u)+\left(a(u,w-u)-\ell(w-u)\right)\\&=\frac{1}{2}a(w-u,w-u)+\mathcal E(u,w-u)\end{align}$$hence the comparison yields the result naturally.
	- **Geometric intuition**: $\mathcal E(u,v)=0$ says exactly the condition that the first linear variation at $u$ vanishes in every direction. To compare two values the only possible way is to substitute the variation into $\mathcal E$ and derive some equivalent condition. 
- **Discussion for the above method**: the method of substitution the variation into $\mathcal E$ works because $J$ is convex ([[Convexity]]) - it contains only a quadratic term and a linear term. Without this condition it might happen that the condition $\mathcal E(u,v)=0$ only ensures local minimum or even a saddle point. 
	- **Counterexample**: if we consider instead the functional defined by $$J(v)=\frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega|\nabla v|^2dx+\int_\Omega\left(\frac{1}{4}v^4-\frac{1}{2}v^2\right)dx,\quad v\in H^1(\Omega)$$then the potential density is non-convex (actually a double-well). The Euler-Lagrange equation at this case is given by $$\mathcal E(u)=-\Delta u+u^3-u=0$$and we notice that $u\equiv0$ is a critical point, but is just a saddle point.
