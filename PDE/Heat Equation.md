A general homogeneous **heat equation** is of the form $$u_t-\alpha\Delta u=0\where\alpha>0$$Here $\alpha$ is called the **thermal diffusivity**, and $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]). 
- **Parabolic boundary**: assume that the heat equation is defined for $(x,t)\in\Omega\times T\subseteq\mathbb R^n\times\mathbb R,$ then the parabolic boundary of $\Omega\times T$ is defined as the union $$\Gamma=(\Omega\times\set{0})\cup(\partial\Omega\times T)$$Intuitively we're only taking the bottom and side into consideration, instead of covering the top of the "cylinder-like" area over which the equation is defined. 
## Maximum principle
**Weak maximum principle**: let $u\in C^2(\Omega_T)\cap C^1(\overline{\Omega_T})$ satisfies $u_t-\alpha\Delta u\le0,\alpha>0$, then $$\max_{\overline{\Omega_T}}u=\max_{\Gamma}u$$**Proof**: by compactness of $\overline{\Omega_T}$ the maximum of $u$ is reached at $(x_0,t_0)\in\overline{\Omega_T}$ ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]), and we'll derive some contradiction from $P_0\in\Omega_T$. Assume first that $u_t-\alpha\Delta u<0$, then by Fermat's law we have $$u_x(x_0,t_0)=0,\quad u_{xx}(x_0,t_0)\le0\qtextq{and}u_t(x_0,t_0)\begin{cases}=0,&\text{if }t_0<T\\\ge0,&\text{if }t_0=T\end{cases}$$Any of the possible cases implies that $u_t-\alpha\Delta u\ge0$, which is a contradiction. Now consider the general case $u_t-\alpha\Delta u\le 0$. For $\varepsilon>0$ consider the auxiliary function $$v_\varepsilon=u-\varepsilon t\imply v_t-\alpha\Delta v=u_t-\alpha\Delta u-\varepsilon<0$$Therefore the deduction above carries over to this case, yielding $$\max_{\overline{\Omega_T}}v=\max_{\Gamma}v$$Now by property of maximum we have $$\max_{\overline{\Omega_T}}u\le\max_{\overline{\Omega_T}}v+\varepsilon T\le\max_\Gamma v+\varepsilon T\le\max_\Gamma u+\varepsilon T$$Taking $\varepsilon\to0$  we completes the proof. 
- **Strong maximum principle**: when maximum of $u$ is reached in the interior of $\Omega_T$ we have that $u$ is constant on $\Omega_T$. This follows directly from the weak maximum principle applied on $\pm u$. 
- **Generalization**: both weak and strong maximum principles applies to general parabolic PDE ([[Linear PDE]]), and the proof for weak version carries over directly, that for strong version relies on Harnack's inequality.
