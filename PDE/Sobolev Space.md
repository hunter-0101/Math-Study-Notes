Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ be an open set of [[Euclidean Space]]. For $1 \le p \le \infty$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the **Sobolev space** $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ is defined as a subset of the [[Lp Space]] by $$W^{k,p}(\Omega) = \Set{ u \in L^p(\Omega) : D^\alpha u \in L^p(\Omega) \text{ for all } |\alpha| \le k }$$where $D^\alpha u=g_\alpha$ is the **weak derivative** defined by the identity $$\int_\Omega u D^\alpha \varphi \, dx = (-1)^{|\alpha|} \int_\Omega g_\alpha \varphi \, dx, \quad \forall \varphi \in C_c^\infty(\Omega)$$The space is equipped with the **Sobolev norm** $$\|u\|_{W^{k,p}(\Omega)} = \begin{cases} \left( \displaystyle\sum_{|\alpha| \le k} \norm{D^\alpha u}_{L^p(\Omega)}^p \right)^{1/p}, & 1 \le p < \infty \\\\ \displaystyle\sum_{|\alpha| \le k} \|D^\alpha u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}, & p = \infty \end{cases}$$
- **Completeness**: $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ is a [[Banach Space]] for all $1 \le p \le \infty$. It is a separable space for $1 \le p < \infty$ and reflexive for $1 < p < \infty$.
- **Hilbert structure**: for $p=2$, we denote $H^k(\Omega) = W^{k,2}(\Omega)$, which is a [[Hilbert Space]] with the inner product defined by $$\langle u, v \rangle_{H^k} = \sum_{|\alpha| \le k} \langle D^\alpha u, D^\alpha v \rangle_{L^2}$$
- **Meyers-Serrin theorem**: for $p < \infty$, $C^\infty(\Omega) \cap W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ is dense in $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$. Note that $C^\infty(\overline{\Omega})$ is dense only if $\partial \Omega$ is sufficiently regular (e.g., Lipschitz).
- **Approximation by $C_c^\infty$**: We define $$W_0^{k,p}(\Omega) = \overline{C_c^\infty(\Omega)}^{\|\cdot\|_{k,p}}$$This space conceptually represents functions in $W^{k,p}$ that "vanish on the boundary."
- **Threshold of weak differentiability**: to understand the scope of $W^{k,p}$, consider these two distinct cases in $\mathbb{R}$:
	1. **The Kink ($f(x) = |x|$)**: $f \in W^{1,p}(-1, 1)$. Its weak derivative is the signum function, which is in $L^p$. This shows Sobolev spaces accommodate functions that are continuous but lack classical derivatives at isolated points.
	2. **The Jump ($f(x) = H(x)$, Heaviside)**: $f \notin W^{1,p}(-1, 1)$ because its distributional derivative is the Dirac delta $\delta_0$, which is not an $L^p$ function. This clarifies that Sobolev functions must possess a degree of "absolute continuity."
## Trace operator
Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary. The trace operator $T: W^{1,p}(\Omega) \to L^p(\partial \Omega)$ is the unique bounded linear operator such that: $$Tu = u|_{\partial \Omega} \quad \text{for all } u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega) \cap C(\overline{\Omega})$$
- **Motivation**: in $L^p(\Omega)$, functions are defined almost everywhere, making the restriction to a boundary $\partial \Omega$ (a set of measure zero) ill-defined. The **Trace Operator** $T$ provides a rigorous way to assign boundary values.
- **Boundedness**: There exists $C > 0$ such that $\|Tu\|_{L^p(\partial \Omega)} \le C \|u\|_{W^{1,p}(\Omega)}$.
- **Characterization of $W_0^{1,p}$**: A crucial result is that $u \in W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)$ if and only if $Tu = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$. This is the standard tool for formulating Dirichlet boundary conditions $u=0$ in weak formulations of PDEs.
- **Range (Fractional Sobolev Spaces)**: The range of the trace operator is not $L^p(\partial \Omega)$ but the Besov space $W^{1-1/p, p}(\partial \Omega)$. This loss of "half a derivative" (for $p=2$) is a fundamental regularity gap in elliptic theory.
## Sobolev inequalities
Sobolev inequalities provide the quantitative link between a function's integrability (or continuity) and the integrability of its derivatives.
- **Poincaré inequality**: for $1 \le p < \infty$ and $\Omega$ bounded in at least one direction (say, between two hyperplanes), there exists $C(\Omega, p)$ such that: $$\|u\|_{L^p(\Omega)} \le C \|\nabla u\|_{L^p(\Omega)}, \quad \forall u \in W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)$$**Proof**: assume $\Omega \subseteq \{0 < x_1 < a\}$. For $u \in C_c^\infty(\Omega)$, write $$u(x_1, \dots, x_d) = \int_0^{x_1} \partial_1 u(t, x_2, \dots, x_d) \, dt$$Applying Jensen's inequality ([[Convexity]]) and integrating over $\Omega$ yields the result. The general case follows by density.
	- **Application**: This inequality allows us to use $\|\nabla u\|_{L^p}$ as an equivalent norm on $W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)$, which is the backbone of the Lax-Milgram theorem for elliptic PDEs.
- **Friedrichs' Inequality**: this is a generalization of Poincaré for functions not necessarily in $W_0^{1,p}$. If $\Omega$ is a bounded connected Lipschitz domain, then: $$\|u\|_{L^p(\Omega)}^p \le C \left( \int_\Omega |\nabla u|^p \, dx + \left| \int_\Omega u \, dx \right|^p \right), \quad \forall u \in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$$This shows that a function is controlled by its gradient plus its "mean state." It is a fundamental tool for solving Neumann boundary value problems.
- **Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality**: for $1 \le p < d$, let $p^* = \frac{dp}{d-p}$. There exists $C(d, p)$ such that: $$\|u\|_{L^{p^*}(\mathbb{R}^d)} \le C \|\nabla u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)}, \quad \forall u \in C_c^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$$
	- **Practical Tool (Rellich-Kondrachov)**: For bounded $\Omega$, the embedding $W^{1,p}(\Omega) \hookrightarrow L^q(\Omega)$ is **compact** for $1 \le q < p^*$. This is the "compactness engine" used to prove the existence of minimizers in the Calculus of Variations and solutions to nonlinear PDEs.
