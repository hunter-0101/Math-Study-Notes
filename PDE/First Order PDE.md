A typical first order PDE with two dimension is of the form $$F(x,y,u(x,y),u_x(x,y),u_y(x,y))=0$$Boundary value problem (BVP) has conditions specified at the extremes while IVP has all conditions specified at the same value of the independent variables. This is because the general solution of PDE usually involves some arbitrary functions, which require an entire BV to specify. Generally we have 5 sets of boundary conditions: $$\begin{array}{l}\text{Dirichlet}& u=f \\\text{Neumann}& \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial n}=f \\\text{Robin}& c_0u+c_1\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial n}=f \\\text{Mixed}& u=f\text{ or }c_0y+c_i\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial n}=g \\\text{Cauchy}& u=f ,\quad\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial u}=g\end{array}$$In general an BVP may have different types of conditions on different boundaries, or even multiple types of conditions on the same different boundary for different intervals..
**Well-posed problems**: refersπ to a PDE problem in a domain together with a set of initial/boundary conditions that enjoys the following properties:
- **Existence**: there exists at least one solution $u(x,t)$ satisfying the conditions (otherwise it's called **overdetermined**).
- **Uniqueness**: there is at most one solution (otherwise it's called **underdetermined**).
- **Stability**: the unique solution $u$ depends in a stable manner on the data of the problem, i.e., if the data are changed a little, the corresponding solution changes only a little.
Below we'll focus on first order Linear PDE. An linear equation is of the form $$\mathcal Lu=0$$where $\mathcal L$ is a linear differential operator (say, $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+y\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$). Linear equations admits the principle of superposition.
## Method of characteristics
Consider the general first order (quasi-)linear PDE of the form $$Lu=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i(x)\partial_iu(x)=f(x)$$Consider a parametric curve $C\subset\mathbb R^n$, then by [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]] we have $$C(t)=(x_1(t),\cdots,x_n(t))\in\mathbb R^n\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\frac{du}{dt}=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}\frac{dx_i}{dt}$$notice its similarity in form with PDE, if we first solve the [[Linear ODE System]] $$\frac{dx_i}{dt}=\alpha_i(x),\quad\forall 1\le i\le n$$then the solution curve (referred to as the **characteristic curve**) can be obtained, and along this curve the original PDE is transformed into a simple [[First Order ODE]] $$\frac{du}{dt}=f(x(t))$$and the above two equations, combined together, yields the solution to the original PDE. The final solution calculated in the above manner contains a undetermined coefficient, and when a BV is given we can use the solution to the system $\frac{dx_i}{dt}=\alpha_i(x)$ to determine its expression in terms of $x_i$, and by substitution an exact solution can be obtained
- **Intuition**: the key idea is that, any linear first order PDE is essentially describing the gradient along a specific direction of a multivariate function, and to expose the direction explicitly we try to find a curve along which the PDE is exactly its derivative via chain rule.
- **Variable coefficient**: consider $u_x+yu_y=0$. it's stating that the directional derivative along $(1,y)$ is zero. As on the $xOy$ plane the solution to $\frac{dy}{dx}=y$ is $y=Ce^x$ (which we call the **characteristic curve**), we have $\frac{d}{dx}u(x,Ce^x)=0$, meaning that $u(x,y)=f(C)=f(e^{-x}y)$.
- **Boundary condition**: when solving an actual BV problem there is usually one intersection point between the characteristic curve and the original boundary. To calculate the IV of ODE along characteristic curve if suffices to first find the intersection point $(x_0,t_0)$, and then substitute it into the BV. This introduces a new parameter specifying the intersection (used to determine the characteristic curve under discussion), which will be canceled out to get the final solution via substitution.
	- **How to determine a BV**: usually in actual calculations there could be some complicated BV. The key idea is that, the characteristics decomposes the domain of definition into curves along which the PDE is turned into an ODE, hence the BV for ODEs can be chosen arbitrarily (each determining a characteristic curve), while the BV for the resulting ODE depends on the chosen characteristics.
### Worked example
1. **Basic first order PDE**: We try to solve the BVP $$\begin{cases}\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial t}+(x+t)\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x}+u=x,&x\in\mathbb R,t>0\\u(x,0)=x\end{cases}$$by introducing a new parameter $s$ we get $$\begin{cases}\dfrac{dt}{ds}=1\\\dfrac{dx}{ds}=x+t\\x(0)=c\end{cases}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad x(t)=e^t(1+c)-(1+t)$$here we're substituting $s$ directly with $t$ by the first equation, which is **quite common** in practical scenarios. Now by the above substitution the original PDE is transformed into $$\begin{cases}\dfrac{du}{dt}+u(t)=e^t(1+c)-(1+t)\\u(0)=u(x(0),0)=u(c,0)=c\end{cases}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad u(t)=\frac{1}{2}(c+1)e^t+\frac{1}{2}(c-1)e^{-t}-t$$since we can solve from the solution of ODEs to get $$c=(x+t+1)e^{-t}-1$$by substitution the final solution to the BVP is $$u(x,t)=\frac{1}{2}e^{-2t}(x+t+1)-e^{-t}+\frac{1}{2}(x-t+1)$$
2. **Special BV**: we try to solve the BVP $$\begin{cases}u_{tt}-u_{xx}=0,&x\in\mathbb R,t>at\\u|_{t=ax}=u_0(x),&x\in\mathbb R\\ u_t|_{t=ax}=u_1(x),&x\in\mathbb R\end{cases}$$The first idea is to decompose the second order differential operator into $$\partial_{tt}-\partial_{xx}=(\partial_t+\partial_x)(\partial_t-\partial_x)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\begin{cases} u_t-u_x=v\\v_t+v_x=0\end{cases}$$Now the key challenge is the transformed BV: for $u$ this is direct, but for $v$ we need to notice that in $v(x,t)=u_x(x,t)-u_x(x,t)$ the second term is not explicitly given. To this end we utilize the chain rule ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) to get $$u_0'(x)=\frac{d u(x,ax)}{dx}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dx}+\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\frac{d(ax)}{dx}=u_x(x,ax)+au_t(x,ax)$$hence we can deduce that $$u_x(x,ax)=u_0'(x)-au_t(x,ax)=u_0'(x)-au_1(x)$$which implies that the BV for $v$ is $$v(x,ax)=u_t(x,ax)-u_x(x,ax)=(1+a)u_1(x)-u_0'(x)$$Now we can apply the method of characteristics to the following two BVPs: $$\begin{cases}u_t-u_x=v\\u(x,ax)=u_0(x)\end{cases}\quad\text{and}\quad\begin{cases}v_t+v_x=0\\v(x,ax)=(1+a)u_1(x)-u_0'(x)\end{cases}$$A little bit more effort is required for solving these two BVPs. For the second problem, the characteristic is $x_1=t+c_1$, and its intersection with $t=ax$ is $$x=\frac{c}{1-a},\quad t=\frac{ac}{1-a}$$hence from the second BVP we have $$v(x,t)=v(x,ax)=(1+a)u_1\left(\frac{x-t}{1-a}\right)+u_0'\left(\frac{x-t}{1-a}\right)$$Similarly we derive the intersection for the first problem and use integration to derive $$u(x,t)=u_0\left(\frac{x+t}{1+a}\right)+\int_{\frac{a(x+t)}{1+a}}^t\left((1+a)u_1\left(\frac{x+t-2\tau}{1-a}\right)-u_0'\left(\frac{x+t-2\tau}{1-a}\right)\right)d\tau$$By direct simplification we get $$u(x,t)=\frac{1+a}{2}u_0\left(\frac{x+t}{1+a}\right)+\frac{1-a}{2}u_0\left(\frac{x-t}{1-a}\right)+\frac{1-a^2}{2}\int_\frac{x-t}{1-a}^\frac{x+t}{1+a}u_1(s)ds$$Now we finish the solving process of the original BVP.
