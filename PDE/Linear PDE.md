Given an open set $\Omega$, a linear PDE is of the form $$Lu=f\quad\text{where}\quad L=\sum_{|\alpha|\le n}a_\alpha\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^\alpha,\quad a_\alpha\in\mathbb C$$Here $L$ is referred to as the **linear partial differential operator**. We'll mainly consider the space $C_0^\infty(\Omega)$ of infinitely differentiable functions of compact support.
## Second order linear PDE
Consider the second order linear PDEs with constant coefficients: $$\sum_{i,j}a_{ij}u_{x_ix_j}+\sum_{i}b_iu_{x_i}+cu=f\quad\text{where}\quad a_{ij}=a_{ji},\quad\forall i\neq j$$Mimicking theory of [[Quadratic Form]] we can classify these equations into three categories:
1. **Elliptic PDE**: the eigenvalues are all positive or all negative, like the [[Laplace's Equation]].
2. **Parabolic PDE**: the eigenvalues are all positive or all negative, except one that is zero, like the [[Heat Equation]].
3. **Hyperbolic PDE**: there is only one negative eigenvalue and all the rest are positive, or there is only one positive eigenvalue and all the rest are negative, like the [[Wave Equation]]. 
	- **Ultra-hyperbolic PDE**: there is more than one positive eigenvalue and more than one negative eigenvalue, and there are no zero eigenvalues
Any PDE in each category can be transformed into the representative in a manner similar to the [[Eigendecomposition]]: denote $A=(a_{ij})$, then by [[Matrix]] there exists $P\in\gl_n(\mathbb R)$ s.t. $P^TAP=\Lambda$, hence setting $y=Px$ and using [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]] we get $$\pard{}{x}=\pard{}{y}\pard{y}{x}=P\pard{}{y}$$And the resulting representation in this new coordinate is $$\paren{\pard{}{x}}^TA\paren{\pard{}{x}}=\paren{P\pard{}{y}}^TA\paren{P\pard{}{y}}=\paren{\pard{}{y}}^T\paren{P^TAP}\paren{\pard{}{y}}$$which is diagonalized.
