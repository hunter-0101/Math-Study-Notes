Given an open set $\Omega$, a linear PDE is of the form $$Lu=f\quad\text{where}\quad L=\sum_{|\alpha|\le n}a_\alpha\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^\alpha,\quad a_\alpha\in\mathbb C$$We'll mainly consider the space $C_0^\infty(\Omega)$ of infinitely differentiable functions of compact support.
## Uniqueness
We mainly rely on the **energy method** for proving the uniqueness theorem for linear PDE. In general formulation, if we're given a BVP on the interval $I$ by $$\begin{cases}Lu=f,&\text{on }I\\\text{initial condition},&\text{on }I\\\text{boundary condition},&\text{for t>0}\end{cases}$$then the detailed procedures of the energy method is: 
1. **Construction**: multiply the equation by $u$ in the case of heat equation, or by $u_t$ in the case of the wave equation. In general case some other multipliers are needed.
2. **Integration**: integrate both sides over the interval.
3. **Manipulation**: use integration by parts and the boundary condition to rewrite som terms.
After that we'll usually find a quantity of the form $$\mathcal E(t)=\int_0^Le(x,t)dx$$that is constant or non-increasing, and whose value at $t=0$ depends only on the initial data. With these information it's usually possible to deduce an uniqueness theorem for the PDE in the following way: take $u,v$ two solutions, and consider $w=u-v$. We know that $$Lw=0$$moreover, it will solve homogeneous initial conditions and boundary conditions, then by considering $\mathcal E(t)$ for $w$ it's usually possible to deduce that $w\equiv0$.
### Worked example
- **[[Heat Equation]]**: consider the Heat Equation problem $$\begin{cases}u_t-Cu_{xx}=0,&(x,t)\in[0,L]\times(0,\infty)\\u(x,0)=g(x),&x\in[0,L]\\u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0,&t>0\end{cases}$$multiplying by $u$ and integrate over $I=[0,L]$ we get $$\int_Iuu_tdx=C\int_Iuu_{xx}dx$$On one hand, notice that LHS can be written as $$\int_Iuu_tdx=\frac{1}{2}\int_I\frac{d}{dt}(u^2)dx=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}\int_Iu^2dx\right)$$while by integration by parts ([[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) RHS can be written as $$\int_Iuu_{xx}dx=uu_{x}|_0^L-\int_Iu_x^2dx=-\int_Iu_x^2dx$$where the boundary condition is used for the last equality. Thus we have $$\frac{d}{dt}\mathcal E(t)\coloneqq\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}\int_Iu^2dx\right)=-C\int_Iu_x^2dx\le0$$Meanwhile, by IV we know that $$\mathcal E(0)=\frac{1}{2}\int_Ig^2dx$$hence if we're given two solutions $u,v$, taking $w=u-v$, then by linearity it solves the above heat equation with homogeneous BV and IV, while means $$\int_Iw^2dx=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad w\equiv0$$hence the above problem has at most one solution. 
- **[[Wave Equation]]**: consider the wave equation problem $$\begin{cases}u_{tt}-c^2u_{xx}=f(x,t),&x\in\mathbb R,t>0\\u(x,0)=g(x),&x\in\mathbb R,t>0\\u_t(x,0)=h(x),&x\in\mathbb R,t>0\end{cases}$$We consider the energy function $$\mathcal E(t)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{x_0-c(t_0-t)}^{x_0+c(t_0-t)}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2)dx$$then by [[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]] and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have $$\begin{align}\frac{d}{dt}\mathcal E(t)=&\int_{x_0-c(t_0-t)}^{x_0+c(t_0-t)}(u_tu_{tt}+c^2u_xu_{xt})dx-\frac{c}{2}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2)|_{x_0+c(t_0-t)}-\frac{c}{2}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2)|_{x_0-c(t_0-t)}\\=&\int_{x_0-c(t_0-t)}^{x_0+c(t_0-t)}u_t(u_{tt}-c^2u_{xx})dx-\frac{c}{2}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2-2cu_tu_x)|_{x_0+c(t_0-t)}\\&-\frac{c}{2}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2+2cu_tu_x)|_{x_0-c(t_0-t)}\\\le&0+0+0=0\end{align}$$hence we can immediately derived the desired identity $\mathcal E(t)=0$, further implying $u=0$.
## Stability
We mainly rely on the **energy inequality** for proving the stability theorem for linear PDE. 
- **[[Wave Equation]]**: consider the characteristic cone of $(x_0,t_0)$ given by $$K=\set{(x,t):x_0-a(t_0-t)\le x\le x_0+a(t_0-t)},\quad K_\tau=K\cap\set{0\le t\le \tau}$$and its boundary decomposed into $$\partial K_\tau=\Omega_0\cup\Omega_\tau\cup\Gamma_{\tau1}\cup\Gamma_{\tau2}\where\Omega_0=[x_0-a(t_0-t),x_0+a(t_0-t)]\times\set{0}$$and $\Omega_\tau$ the horizontal line parallel to $\Omega_0$, $\Gamma_{\tau1},\Gamma_{\tau2}$ the rest. In general we have $$\int_{\Omega_\tau}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2)dx\le e^{t_0}\left(\int(h^2+c^2g_x^2)dx+\int_{K_\tau}f^2dxdt\right)$$**Proof**: multiply $u_t$ on both sides of the wave equation and integrate, we get $$\int_{K_\tau}u_t(u_{tt}-c^2u_{xx})dxdt=\int_{K_\tau}u_tfdxdt$$Notice that by [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]] and Green's theorem ([[PDE Gallery]]) LHS can be re-written as $$\begin{align}J&=\int_{K_\tau}\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2)-c^2\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(u_tu_x)\right)dxdt\\&=-\int_{\partial K_\tau}\left(c^2(u_tu_x)dt+\frac{1}{2}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2)dx\right)\\&=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega_\tau}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2)dx-\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega_0}(h^2+c^2g_x^2)dx-\int_{\Gamma_{\tau1}\cup\Gamma_{\tau2}}\left(c^2(u_tu_x)dt+\frac{1}{2}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2)dx\right)\\&\coloneqq J_1+J_2+J_3\end{align}$$by direct computation we can easily verify that $J_3\ge0$, hence the above yields $$\int_{\Omega_\tau}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2)dx\le\int_{\Omega_0}(h^2+c^2g_x^2)dx+2\int_{K_\tau}u_tfdxdt$$we can further use the AM-GM inequality to get $$\frac{dG(\tau)}{d\tau}\le G(\tau)+F(\tau)\where G(\tau)=\int_{K_\tau}(u_t^2+c^2u_x^2), F(\tau)=\int_{\Omega_0}(h^2+c^2g_x^2)dx+\int_{K_\tau}f^2dxdt$$now the desired result follows from the Grönwall's inequality ([[Comparison Theorem]]).
## Weak solution
Define the adjoint operator ([[Operator]]) of $L$ as $$L^*=\sum_{|\alpha|\le n}(-1)^{|\alpha|}\overline{a_\alpha}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^\alpha$$it's called adjoint since it can be verified by integration by parts that $$\braket{L\varphi,\psi}=\braket{\varphi,L^*\psi},\quad\forall\varphi,\psi\in C_0^\infty(\Omega)$$We say that $u$ is a **weak solution** of $Lu=f$ if $$\braket{f,\psi}=\braket{u,L^*\psi},\quad\forall \psi\in C_0^\infty(\Omega)$$Its significance is that this loosened conditions allows "solutions" that are not differentiable, providing more flexibilities.
- **Existence of weak solution**: given $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$ a bounded open subset and $L$ a linear differential operator, there exists $K\in\mathcal B(L^2(\Omega))$ s.t. $L(Kf)=f$ in the weak sense whenever $f\in L^2(\Omega)$.
  **Proof**: we need the inequality $\|L^*\psi\|_2\ge c\|\psi\|_2$ proved below. Consider a pre-Hilbert space $$\mathcal H_0=C_0^\infty(\Omega),\quad\braket{\varphi,\psi}_{\mathcal H_0}=\braket{L^*\varphi,L^*\psi}_{L^2}$$Let $\mathcal H$ be its completion ([[Hilbert Space]]), then since $\|\psi\|_{\mathcal H_0}=\|L^*\psi\|_2\ge c\|\psi\|_2$ we know that any Cauchy sequence of $\mathcal H$ is also a Cauchy sequence of $L^2(\Omega)$, hence we can identity $\mathcal H$ with a subspace of $L^2(\Omega)$. Also, $L^*\in\mathcal B(\mathcal H_0,L^2(\Omega))$ extends uniquely to $\mathcal H$ ([[FT on L2]]). Now given a fixed $f\in L^2(\Omega)$ consider the functional $$\ell_0:L^2(\Omega)\to\mathbb C,\quad\ell_0(\psi)=\braket{\psi,f}_{\mathcal H_0},\quad\forall\psi\in C_0^\infty(\Omega)$$by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have $$\begin{align}|\ell_0(\psi)|=\left|\braket{\psi,f}\right|&\le\|\psi\|_2\|f\|_2\\&\le c^{-1}\|L^*\psi\|_2\|f\|_2\\&\le c'\|\psi\|_0\end{align}$$where $c'=c^{-1}\|f\|_2$, hence $\ell_0$ is bounded, and can be extended uniquely to $\ell\in\mathcal B(\mathcal H,\mathbb C)$ with $\|\ell\|\le c^{-1}\|f\|_2$. By Riesz representation theorem ([[Dual Space]]) there exists $U\in\mathcal H$ s.t. $$\ell(\psi)=\braket{\psi,U}_{\mathcal H}=\braket{L^*\psi,L^*U}_2,\quad\forall \psi\in C_0^\infty(\Omega)$$Denote $u=L^*U\in L^2(\Omega)$, then $\ell(\psi)=\braket{\psi,f}=\braket{L^*\psi,u}$, hence by definition $u$ is a weak solution of $Lu=f$. Let $Kf=u$, then $Kf$ is uniquely determined by $f$, and $$\|Kf\|_2=\|u\|_2=\|L^*U\|+2=\|U\|_0\le c^{-1}\|f\|_2$$hence $K\in\mathcal B(L^2(\Omega))$.
	- **Proof of $\|L^*\psi\|_2\ge c\|\psi\|_2$**: 
	- **Intuition**: issue of existence of weak solution boils down to whether $f\in\im L$. Since $(\im L)^\perp=\ker L^*$, what we essentially wanna show is $\ker L^*=\set{0}$, i.e., $L^*$ is lower bounded ([[Operator]]). The rest is some standard application of completion, extension theorem, and Riesz representation theorem. 
## Duhamel's principle
**Duhamel's principle** is a general method for obtaining solutions to **inhomogeneous linear PDE** like [[Wave Equation]], heat equation, variation equation, etc.. 
Formally, consider a linear inhomogeneous equation for $u:D\times(0,\infty)\to\mathbb R$ where $D\subset\mathbb R^n$ by $$\begin{cases}u_t(x,t)-Lu(x,y)=f(x,t),&(x,t)\in D\times(0,\infty)\\u|_{\partial D}=0,\\u(x,0)=0,&x\in D\end{cases}$$where $L$ is a linear differential operator that involves no time derivatives. Duhamel's principle is, formally, that the solution to this problem is $$u(x,t)=\int_0^t(P^sf)(x,t)ds$$where $P^sf$ is the solution of the problem $$\begin{cases}v_t-Lv=0,&(x,t)\in D\times(s,\infty)\\v|_{\partial D}=0,\\v(x,s)=f(x,s),&x\in D\end{cases}$$here $P^s$ can be thought as the inverse of the operator $\partial_t-L$ for the Cauchy problem with initial condition $f(x,s)$.
