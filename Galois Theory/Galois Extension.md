A **Galois extension** is a [[Field Extension]] $L/K$ that is algebraic, normal, and separable. 
- **Insights & motivation**: the fundamental insight of Galois is that the structure of an extension is governed by the symmetries of the roots of a polynomial. If $f(x) \in K[x]$ is a separable polynomial, then the elements of $\gal\paren{\Sigma_{f/K}/K}$ act as permutations of the set of roots of $f$, preserving all algebraic relations over $K$.
- **Splitting field characterization**: for finite extensions, $L/K$ is Galois if and only if $L$ is the splitting field of some separable polynomial $f(x) \in K[x]$.
- **Numerical Criterion**: A finite extension $L/K$ is Galois if and only if $$\abs{\aut(L/K)} = [L:K]$$In any algebraic extension, $\abs{\aut(L/K)}\le [L:K]_{s} \le [L:K]$; equality marks the maximal symmetry possible.
- **The "Fixed Field" Perspective**: Galois theory establishes that the "amount" of $L$ that is not moved by the symmetry group is exactly the base field $K$. Formally, $L/K$ is Galois $\iff L^{\text{Gal}(L/K)} = K$.
## Fundamental theorem of Galois theory
The **Galois group** of a Galois extension $L/K$ is defined as $$\gal(L/K)=\aut(L/K)=\Set{\phi\in\aut L:\phi|_K=\id_K}$$Obviously we have $(\gal(L/K),\circ)$ being a [[Group]]. Moreover, we adopt the following notations:
- **Galois group of intermediate field**: the Galois group of $L/M/K$ is defined as $$G_M=\gal(L/M)$$which is the group of automorphisms of $L$ fixing $M$.
- **Fixed field of subgroup**: the fixed field of subgroup $H\le G$ is defined as $$\quad L^H=\set{x\in L:h(x)=x,\forall h\in H}$$This notation is consistent with our convention in [[Group Action]].
**Fundamental theorem of Galois theory**: given $L/K$ a Galois extension, then:
1. **Antitone [[Lattice]] isomorphism**: we have the antitone lattice isomorphism $$\phi:\lat(L/K)\to\sub\gal(L/K),\quad M\mapsto \gal(L/M)$$With its inverse given by $$\varphi:\sub\gal(L/K)\to\lat(L/K),\quad H\mapsto L^H$$Specifically, the antitone property states that: 
	1. **Order reversal**: we have the equivalence $$M_1\le M_2\qiffq\gal(L/M_2)\le\gal(L/M_1)$$which is actually quite intuitive by definition. 
	2. **Join-meet correspondence**: we have $$\begin{align}\gal(L/\braket{M_1,M_2})&=\gal(L/M_1)\cap\gal(L/M_2)\\\gal(L/(M_1\cap M_2))&=\Braket{\gal(L/M_1),\gal(L/M_2)}\end{align}$$Or equivalently by the isomorphism, we have $$\begin{align}L^{\braket{H_1,H_2}}&=L^{H_1}\cap L^{H_2}\\L^{H_1\cap H_2}&=\Braket{E^{H_1},E^{H_2}}\end{align}$$Note that the first two lines are general more applicable than the last two lines. 
2. **Quantitative correspondence**: we have the **fixed field identity** and **group identity** $$L^{\gal(L/M)}=M,\quad \gal\paren{L/L^H}=H$$and the **Degree-index equality** $$[L:M]=\abs{\gal(L/M)},\quad [M:K]=\abs{\gal(L/K):\gal(L/M)}=\frac{\abs{\gal(L/K)}}{\abs{\gal(L/M)}}$$Here one of the equalities can actually be deduced from another. 
3. **Structural correspondence**: fix $M\in\lat(L/K),\phi(M)=H$, then 
	1. **Conjugation**: for any $\sigma \in G$, we have $$\text{Gal}(K/\sigma(M)) = \sigma H \sigma^{-1}$$That is, isomorphic fields correspond to conjugate subgroups.
	2. **Normal extensions**: $M/K$ is finite separable, with $$M/K\text{ is normal}\quad\iff\quad\gal(L/M)\trianglelefteq\gal(L/K)$$in which case we have an isomorphism $$\gal(M/K)\cong\frac{\gal(L/K)}{\gal(L/M)}$$That is, intermediate fields induces a quotient isomorphism. 
## Other properties
- **Artin’s lemma**: let $G$ be a finite group of automorphisms of a field $L$, then $$\sqbraket{L:L^G}=|G|$$**Proof sketch**: $[L:K] \ge |G|$ follows from Dedekind’s Lemma on the linear independence of characters. $[L:K] \le |G|$ is proven by showing that any set of $|G|+1$ elements in $L$ is linearly dependent over $K$ using a system of linear equations constructed from the group action.
- **Order of the Group**: for a finite Galois extension $L/K$, we have $$|\text{Gal}(L/K)| = [L:K]$$**Proof sketch**: this follows from the definition of a Galois extension as being normal and separable, ensuring that the number of $K$-embeddings $L \to \bar{K}$ (which all land in $L$) equals the degree $[L:K]$.
