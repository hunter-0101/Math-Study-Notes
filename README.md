# 📚 Math Study Notes
This repository contains a personal, evolving collection of notes and syntheses on various topics in mathematics.

## 📝 About This Collection

This collection serves as an ongoing personal record of concepts, theorems, proofs, and examples encountered during my self-study and formal engagement with mathematics. It is a work in progress, intended primarily as a resource for consolidating my understanding and reviewing material.

The notes cover a diverse range of areas, including (but not limited to):

* **Analysis:** Real, Complex, and Functional Analysis.
* **Algebra:** Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, and Ring Theory.
* **Topology:** General and Algebraic Topology.
* **Geometry:** Differential Geometry.
* **Foundations:** Set Theory and Logic.

## 🙏 A Note on Shortcomings and Feedback

Writing mathematical exposition is a continuous learning process. Given the highly technical nature of the material, I fully acknowledge that these notes may contain **areas for improvement, notational inconsistencies, or even outright errors**.

This is why I warmly welcome and appreciate any constructive feedback!

If you happen to come across a **typographical error, a confusing explanation, an inaccurate statement, or an opportunity for a clearer proof**, please do not hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your input is invaluable in helping me refine my understanding and improve the quality of this resource.

**Learning is collaborative, and I am keen to learn from the wider mathematical community.**

Thank you for your understanding and for taking the time to review this material.
