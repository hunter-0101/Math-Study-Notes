A **Euclidean vector space** is a finite-dimensional ([[Vector Space]]) inner-product space over $\mathbb R$ ([[Real Number System]]), which is naturally a [[Hilbert Space]] by completeness of $\mathbb R$. 
## Affine structure
An **affine space** is a tuple $(A,\vec A)$ consisting of a set $A$, its associated vector space $\vec A$, and a transitive and free [[Group Actions]] of additive group $\vec A$ on the set $A$.
- **Euclidean (affine) space**: a Euclidean affine space is an affine space over $\mathbb R$ whose associated vector space is a Euclidean vector space.
- **Affine subspace**:
