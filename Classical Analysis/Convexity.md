Given $S$ a [[Vector Space]] over some ordered [[Field]], a subset $C\subset S$ is **convex** if $$(1-t)x+ty\in C,\quad\forall x,y\in C,t\in[0,1]$$We say that $C$ is **strictly convex** if the above expression is in the topological interior ([[Point Set Topology]]) of $C$.
## Convex function
Given $X$ a convex subset of real vector space, and $f:X\to\mathbb R$ a function. $f$ is called **convex** iff $$f(tx_1+(1-t)x_2)\le tf(x_1)+(1-t)f(x_2),\quad\forall x_1,x_2\in X,t\in[0,1]$$We can define **strict convexity** similarly. $f$ is **concave** if $-f$ is convex. 
- **Convexity criterion**: some useful criteria for convexity is listed below. We'll denote $S$ the domain of definition.
	- **$C^1$ function**: $f\in C^1(S)$ is convex iff $$\nabla f(x)\cdot(y-x)\le f(y)-f(x)$$whose proof is direct based on the definition.
	- **$C^2$ function**: $f\in C^2(S)$ is convex iff we have the definite condition ([[Quadratic Form]]) $$H_f\succeq0$$where $H_f$ is the Hessian matrix ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]). The proof follows from the Taylor's theorem.
- **Jensen's inequality**: given $w\ge0,\|w\|_1=1$ and $\varphi$ convex on $[a,b]$, if $f$ is measurable with $\im f\subset [a,b],fw\in L^1(E)$ ([[Lp Space]]) we have $$\varphi\left(\int_Efw\right)\le\int_E(\varphi\circ f)\cdot w$$**Proof**: by convexity at $x_0=\int_Efw$ we may pick $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb R$ s.t. $$\varphi(x)\ge \alpha x+\beta,\quad\forall x\in[a,b]\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\varphi\circ f\ge\alpha f+\beta$$Multiply $w$ and integrate both sides over $E$, we get $$\int_E(\varphi\circ f)\cdot w\ge\alpha\int_Efw+\beta=\alpha x_0+\beta=\varphi(x_0)=\varphi\left(\int_Efw\right)$$which completes the proof.
	- **Intuition**: we're essentially relying on the geometric interpretation that any convex combination of points within a convex set still lies within the set. Further if $\varphi$ is homogeneous we can actually weaken our condition to $\|w\|<\infty$.
