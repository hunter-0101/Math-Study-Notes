For $V$ a (finite-dimensional) [[Vector Space]] over [[Field]] $F$, a **bilinear form** is a map $$B:V\times V\to F$$that is linear in both variables. Some basic concepts and further generalizations can be found in [[Exterior Algebra]], in which we talk about $k$-linear forms ($k$-tensors).
- **Associated quadratic form**: obviously any symmetric bilinear form $B$ can be naturally associated with a quadratic form $Q(u)=B(u,u)$.
	- **Definiteness**: definiteness of $B$ is defined via that of associated $Q$. 
	- **Polarization identity**: given quadratic form $Q$ its associated bilinear form $B$ is given by $$B(u,v)=\frac{1}{2}(Q(u+v)-Q(u)-Q(v))$$which is valid provided that $\char F\neq2$.
	  **Proof**: by definition we have $$Q(u+v)=B(u+v,u+v)=B(u,u)+2B(u,v)+B(v,v)$$This simplifies to the desired equality by identifying $B(u,u)=Q(u),B(v,v)=Q(v)$. 
- **Properties**
	- **Derivative**: given functions $x,y:\mathbb R\to V$ we have $$\frac{d}{dt}B(x,y)=B\paren{\frac{dx}{dt},y}+B\paren{x,\frac{dy}{dt}}$$**Proof**: by definition of [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]] we have $$\begin{align}\frac{d}{dt}B(x,y)&=\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{B(x(t+\Delta t),y(t+\Delta t))-B(x(t),y(t))}{\Delta t}\\&=\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{B(x(t+\Delta t),y(t+\Delta t))-B(x(t),y(t+\Delta t))}{\Delta t}\\&\ \ \quad+\lim_{\Delta t\to0}\frac{B(x(t),y(t+\Delta t))-B(x(t),y(t))}{\Delta t}\\&=\lim_{\Delta t\to0}B\paren{\frac{x(t+\Delta t)-x(t)}{\Delta t},y(t+\Delta t)}+\lim_{\Delta t\to0}B\paren{x(t),\frac{y(t+\Delta t)-y(t)}{\Delta t}}\\&=B\paren{\frac{dx}{dt},y}+B\paren{x,\frac{dy}{dt}}\end{align}$$where we've used the property of limit ([[Sequence]]). 
## Gram matrix
Given a basis $V=\span(v_i:1\le i\le n)$ ([[Vector Space]]) a bilinear form $B$ can be characterized by its Gram [[Matrix]] representation $$B(x,y)=x^TG_By\where G_B=(B(v_i,v_j))_{n\times n}$$This follows directly from a straightforward calculation based on bilinearity. 
- **Symmetry & Gram matrix**: obviously by definition we have $$G_B\in S^n(F)\quad\iff\quad B(u,v)=B(u,v),\quad\forall u,v\in V$$This is useful in some cases. 
- **Change of basis formula**: given a change of basis $E'=EP$ ([[Vector Space]]) we have $$B(u,v)=x^TG_By=(P^Tx')^TG_B(P^Ty)=x'^T(PG_BP^T)y'$$while implies that the Gram matrix under the new basis is $$G_B'=PG_BP^T$$This is quite similar to that of linear operators.
- **Intuition for Sylvester's law of inertia**: matrix congruence arises as the effect on $G_B$ by change of basis, hence invariance of the signature $(n_+, n_-, n_0)$ is essentially a reflection of the fact that behavior of $B$ itself is independent on the representation on $V$, which is quite intuitive, since after diagonalization congruence acts on eigenvalues by multiplying by a positive constant: $$B(\lambda v,\lambda v)=|\lambda|^2B(v,v)$$This is exactly the same as how we explained eigenvalues being invariant under matrix similarity via change of basis in [[Matrix]]. 
- **$B$-orthogonal basis**: a basis $(v_i)_{i=1}^n$ of $V$ is said to be $B$-orthonormal if $$B(v_i,v_j)=\delta_i^j,\quad\forall1\le i,j\le n$$this is similar to the orthonormal basis defined on [[Inner Product Space]]. 
	- **Orthonormalization via Gram matrix**: given $B$ positive definite, any basis $V=(v_i)_{i=1}^n$ can be $B$-orthonormalized by $$E=VG_B^{-1/2}$$It's $B$-diagonal since by the change of basis formula the new Gram matrix is $$(B(e_i,e_j))_{n\times n}=G_B'=G_B^{-1/2}G_BG_B^{-1/2}=I$$Note that form general symmetric bilinear forms we're also able to find a basis that turn $G_B$ into its canonical form, although concepts like orthogonality makes no sense for it. 
		- This is exactly a realization of GS orthogonalization in [[Inner Product Space]]. It's worth noting that while a bilinear form differs from a inner product (which is a sesquilinear form), they behaves similarly on orthogonality, hence GS orthogonalization is also well-defined for any positive definite bilinear form.
