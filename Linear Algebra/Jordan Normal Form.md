A **Jordan matrix** is a block diagonal matrix consisting of eigen-blocks$$J=\diag(J_{\lambda_1},J_{\lambda_2},\dots, J_{\lambda_r})$$where $J_{\lambda_k}$, with $a_k$ the **algebraic multiplicity** of $\lambda_k$ ([[Eigendecomposition]]), is a $a_k\times a_k$ block diagonal matrix consists of smaller **Jordan blocks** $$J_{\lambda_k}=\diag(J_{\lambda_k,1},\cdots,J_{\lambda_k,g_k})$$where $J_{\lambda_k,i}$, with $g_k$ the **geometric multiplicity** of $\lambda_k$, takes the form $$J_{\lambda_k,i}=\begin{bmatrix}\lambda_j&1\\&\lambda_k&\ddots\\&&\ddots&1\\&&&\lambda_k\end{bmatrix}$$Its size $m_{k,i}$ will be described below.
**Theorem**: any $A\in M_n(F)$ where $F$ is an algebraically closed [[Field]] is similar to a Jordan normal form consisting of all $\lambda_k$ with the same $a_k$, with size of each Jordan block determined uniquely by $A$ up to permutation. 
**Proof**: by [[Eigendecomposition]] we can pick $\lambda_k,1\le k\le r$ the eigenvalues of $A$ with eigenvectors $v_{k,i},1\le i\le g_k$. Now consider the matrix $\lambda_kI-A$. Notice that $$(\lambda_kI-A)v_{k,i}=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\ker(\lambda_kI-A)\neq\varnothing$$ while the kernel of its exponents is non-decreasing and bounded: $$\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^m\subset\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{m+1}\subset F^n,\quad\forall m\in\mathbb N$$Hence by the well-ordering principle ([[Set Theory]]) there exists $m_{k}\in\mathbb N$ at which the expansion stops. This happens only once, since when $\ker A^m=\ker A^{m+1}$ we have $$\begin{align}v\in\ker A^{m+2}&\iff A^{m+2}v=0\iff A^{m+1}(Av)=0\\&\iff Av\in\ker A^{m+1}=\ker A^m\iff A^{m+1}v=0\\&\iff v\in\ker A^{m+1}\Longrightarrow\ker A^{m+1}=\ker A^{m+2}\end{align}$$which can be repeated for any integer larger than $m$. Further we can verify easily that $$F^n=\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{m_k}\oplus\im(\lambda_kI-A)^{m_k}$$as direct sum of invariant subspaces. By induction on dimension, noticing that $\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{}m_k$ contains eigenvectors for only one eigenvalue, we get an **[[Invariant Subspace]] decomposition** $$F^n=\bigoplus_{k=1}^r\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{m_k}$$At this point it suffices to find a Jordan chain in each $\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{m_k}$. Pick $\set{v_{k,j}}$ s.t. $$\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{m_k}-\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{m_k-1}=\span(v_{k,j})$$then $\set{v_{k,j},(\lambda_kI-A)v_{k,j}}$ are linearly independent while $$\span(v_{k,j},(\lambda_kI-A)v_{k,j})\cap\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{m_k-2}=\set{0}$$hence can be enlarged to form a basis for $\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{m_k-1}-\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{m_k-2}$. This can be repeated until it forms a basis for $\ker(\lambda_kI-A)^{m_k}$, which can be separated into several chains $$\set{v_{k,i}^{s}},1\le s\le m_{k,i} \quad\text{s.t.}\quad v_{k,i}^{s-1}=(\lambda_kI-A)v_{k,i}^s,\quad v_{k,i}^1=v_{k,i}$$with $m_k=\sum_{i=1}^{g_k}m_{k,i}$.
- **Total size of Jordan blocks**: the model matrix consisting of Jordan chains transforms a matrix $A$ into a block diagonal matrix in the form described above, and by property of [[Eigendecomposition]] we immediately know that $m_k=a_k$.
- **[[Field]] condition**: for a general field $F$, a matrix $A\in M_n(F)$ has a Jordan normal form iff it splits over $F$, i.e. all its eigenvalues ([[Eigendecomposition]]) lie within $F$.
	- For a real matrix with complex eigenvalues, assume $\lambda_i=a_i+ib_i$, then we have $$C_i=\begin{bmatrix}a_i & -b_i \\ b_i & a_i\end{bmatrix},\quad J_i=\begin{bmatrix}C_i & I&&\\&C_i & \ddots&\\&&\ddots&I\\&&&C_i\end{bmatrix}$$
- **Polynomial of Jordan form**: by induction we can show that for $f\in\mathbb C[x]$ and $J=J_{\lambda}$ we have $$f(J_\lambda)=\begin{bmatrix}f(\lambda)&f'(\lambda)&\tfrac{f''(\lambda)}{2} & \cdots&\tfrac{f^{(n-1)}(\lambda)}{(n-1)!}\\  0&f(\lambda)&f'(\lambda)&\cdots   &\tfrac{f^{(n-2)}(\lambda)}{(n-2)!}\\  \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\ddots&\vdots\\  0 &0&0&f(\lambda)&f'(\lambda)\\  0&0&0&0&f(\lambda)\end{bmatrix}$$or we can also write the above identity in a more compact form $$f(J_\lambda)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{f^{(k)}(\lambda)}{k!}N^k,\quad N=J-\lambda I$$Further by [[Holomorphic Functional Calculus]] we can generalize this result to any $f\in\mathcal O(U)$ given that $\sigma(J_\lambda)\subset U$.
	- **Image of function**: since $f(P^{-1}XP)=P^{-1}f(X)P$, the above formula actually says that $\im f$ is quite large, given some mild conditions like $f'(\lambda)\neq0,\forall\lambda\in\sigma(T)$.
	- **Interpolation**: as long as $X\in M_n(F)$ is upper triangular, and has the same elements along each line parallel to the diagonal, then by [[Hermite Interpolation]] we can find $f$ s.t. $f(J)=X$.
- **Commutant of Jordan block**: by investigating each element it's easy to deduce that $$C_{M_n( F)}(J_\lambda)=\set{p(J_\lambda):p\in F[X]}$$where $F[X]$ is the [[Polynomial Ring]]. Notice that we can assume $\lambda=0$ in the analysis.
	- **Corollary**: by partitioning the matrix into blocks, for $J=\diag{J_1,\cdots, J_r}$ we have that $$C_{M_n(F)}(J)=\set{\diag(p_1(J_1),\cdots,p_n(J_n)):p_i\in F[X],\forall1\le i\le r}$$it suffices to set $X=[X_{ij}]$ for $KX=XJ$ and investigate each $X_{ij}$ separately.
- **Relation with the structure theorem of module over PID**: Jordan normal form can actually be seen as a corollary of the structure theorem of finitely generated [[Module]] over PID.
## $\lambda$-matrix
A **$\lambda$-matrix** is a matrix whose entires are polynomials of $\lambda$. It inherits all definitions/properties of a ordinary matrix, but provide a more general framework to study the behavior of a matrix.
- **Canonical form**: by [[Polynomial]] we can always transform a $\lambda$-matrix into the form $\diag(d_1(\lambda),\cdots,d_r(\lambda),0,\cdots,0)$ where $d_k|d_{k+1}$. We can $d_k$ invariance factors.
- **Determinant factor**: GCD of determinants of all rank $k$ sub-matrices is called the determinant factor. Obviously equivalent matrices have the same determinant factors, hence by the canonical form the $k$-th determinant factor is actually $D_k=d_1\cdots d_k$.
- **Criterion of equivalence**: $A\sim B$ iff they share the same invariant factors/determinant factors. $\Leftarrow$ is obvious, while $\Rightarrow$ follows from the fact that matrix transformation does not change its determinant (and that of sub-matrices).
	- For $A,B\in M_n(F)$, $A\approx B$ iff $\lambda I-A\sim\lambda I-B$, which is obvious. 
- **Base factor**: write $d_k=(\lambda-\lambda_1)^{k_{k1}}\cdots(\lambda-\lambda_r)^{d_{kr}}$, then all terms of the form $(\lambda-\lambda_s)^{d_{ks}},d_{ks}>0$ is called the base factor. Multiplicity is counted. Since set of invariant base factors and set of base factors uniquely determines each other, we have $A\approx B$ iff they share the same set of base factor.
The above results on $\lambda$-matrix provide another (practical) perspective on computation of Jordan normal form. Specifically, notice that any Jordan block has only one base factor $(\lambda-\lambda_i)^{k_i}$, since base fact uniquely determines the canonical form, if all base factors of $A$ is $(\lambda-\lambda_i)^{k_i}$ ($\lambda_i$ might repeat), then each of them corresponds to one Jordan block.
