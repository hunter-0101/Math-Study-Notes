Given $F$ an [[Field]] with an involution $x\mapsto\overline x$ whose **fixed field** of involution $F_0$ is **totally ordered** ([[Order]]) and **Archimedean** ([[Field]]), and **inner product** on an [[Vector Space]] $V$ over $F$, denoted $$\braket{\cdot,\cdot}:V\times V\to F$$is a function satisfying the following axioms:
1. **Hermitian symmetry**: $\braket{u,v}=\overline{\braket{u,v}},\forall u,v\in V$.
2. **Linearity in the first argument**: $\braket{\alpha u+\beta v,w}=\alpha\braket{u,w}+\beta\braket{v,w},\forall\alpha,\beta\in F,u,v,w\in V$.
	- By 1, 2 we have $\braket{ u,\alpha v+\beta w}=\overline\alpha\braket {u,v}+\overline\beta\braket{u,w}$, which is usually called the **conjugate linearity in the second argument**.
3. **Positive definiteness**: $\braket{v,v}\ge0,\forall v\in V$, and $\braket{v,v}=0\iff v=0$.
	- Note that axiom 1 ensures that $\braket{v,v}\in F_0$, hence the comparison is well-defined. 
The tuple $(V,\braket{\cdot,\cdot})$ is called an **inner product space**.
- **Discussion on prerequisites**: all the above requirements on the underlying fields ensures that the inner product defined above is well-defined. Without them an inner product will degenerate to a general [[Bilinear Form]].
	- **Semilinear form**: inner product is one special (also one of the most common) kind of **sesquilinear form**, which is a semilinear form with two variables. Unlike bilinear form, it's a map that is linear "up to a twist" - coefficients might be "twisted" when passing through the forms. 
- **Induced norm**: every inner product induces a **norm** on $V$ by $$\|v\|=\sqrt{\braket{v,v}},\quad\forall v\in V$$It can be verified directly that all axioms of norm ([[Normed Vector Space]]) are satisfied. Therefore an inner product space is naturally a normed vector space.
	- **Continuity of inner product**: we can easily verify that the inner product is a [[Continuous Function]] in the topology induced by the norm induced by the inner product. This follows directly from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality discussed below. 
- **Orthogonality**: for two vectors $u,v\in V$ the orthogonality relation is defined as $$u\perp v\quad\iff\quad\braket{u,v}=0$$This is a generalization to the usual orthogonality on [[Euclidean Space]]. 
## Basic properties
- **Bessel's identity**: given a finite orthonormal set $\set{e_i}_{i=1}^n$ and a vector $v\in V$ we have $$\|v\|^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\abs{\braket{v,e_i}}^2+\norm{v-\sum_{i=1}^n\braket{v,e_i}e_i}^2$$**Proof**: consider the decomposition $$v=\sum_{i=1}^n\braket{v,e_i}e_i+\left(v-\sum_{i=1}^n\braket{v,e_i}e_i\right)$$Denote the second term as $r$, then by orthogonality we have $\braket{e_i,e_j}=\delta_i^j$, and we can also easily verify that $\braket{t,e_i}=0,\forall i$, therefore by expanding $\|v\|^2=\braket{v,v}$ into the summations we can reduce the identity to the expression above. 
	- **Bessel's inequality**: if we throw away the remainder term we get $$\|v\|^2\ge\sum_{i=1}^n\braket{v,e_i}e_i$$This is widely applicable to many different kinds of problems. 
	- **Parseval's identity**: if $\set{e_i}_{i=1}^n$ is a basis for $V$ then the Bessel's identity reduces to $$\|v\|^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\abs{\braket{v,e_i}}^2$$This is also treated as a generalization of Pythagorean's theorem. 
	- **Countable basis**: these results above can be generalized to infinite dimensional vector spaces satisfying certain completeness axioms. This is detailed in [[Hilbert Space]].
- **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality**: in general we have $$\abs{\braket{u,v}}\le\|u\|\cdot\|v\|,\quad\forall u,v\in V$$This is a corollary of Bessel's inequality applied on $e=v/\|v\|$. 
- **Jordan-von Neumann theorem**: for any $u,v\in V$ we have the **parallelogram law** $$\|u+v\|^2+\|u-v\|^2=2(\|u\|^2+\|v\|^2)$$Conversely any [[Normed Vector Space]] $V$ can be given an inner product if the identity is satisfied, with inner product recovered by the **polarization identity** $$\begin{cases}\Re\braket{u,v}=\frac{1}{4}(\|u+v\|^2-\|u-v\|^2)\\\braket{u,v}=\Re\braket{u,v}+i\Re\braket{u,iv}\end{cases}\quad\text{or}\quad\langle u,v\rangle=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{k=0}^3i^k\|u+i^kv\|^2$$satisfying all required properties. 
	- **Polarization inequality**: given any normed vector space $(X,\|\cdot\|)$ define $$C_{u,v}=\frac{\|u+v\|^2+\|u-v\|^2}{2(\|u\|^2+\|v\|^2)},\quad\forall u,v\in X$$let $a=\inf C_{u,v},b=\sup C_{u,v}$, then $\frac{1}{2}\le a\le 1\le b\le 2$ with $ab=1$. Further, it can be induced by an inner product iff $a=b=1$. Here $b$ is the **von Neumann constant**.
	  **Proof**: all inequalities follows from triangle inequality, and the fact that $ab=1$ follows from the observation that $C_{u+v,u-v}=1/C_{u,v}$.
## Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
**Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization** is a standardized process to obtain the orthonormal basis of a [[Vector Space]]. Essentially, define the **vector projection** operator by $$\pi_u( v)=\frac{\braket{v,u}}{\braket{u,u}}u\imply u\perp(v-\pi_uv)$$then the Gram-Schmidt process can be formalized as $$\begin{align}u_1&=v_1, & e_1&=\frac{u_1}{\|u_1\|}\\u_2 & = v_2-\pi_{u_1} (v_2),& e_2 & = \frac{u_2}{\|u_2\|} \\u_3 & = v_3-\pi_{u_1} (v_3) - \pi_{u_2} (v_3),&e_3 & = \frac{u_3 }{\|u_3\|} \\& \ \ \vdots & & \ \ \vdots \\u_k & = v_k - \sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\pi_{u_j} (v_k),&e_k & = \frac{u_k}{\|u_k\|}\end{align}$$The resulting basis is usually denoted as $(e_\lambda)=\mathrm{GS}(v_n:n\in\mathbb N)$. 
- **Change of basis formula**: given $(e_i:1\le i\le n)=\mathrm{GS}(v_i:1\le i\le n)$ we have $$\begin{pmatrix}v_1&\cdots&v_n\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}e_1&\cdots&e_n\end{pmatrix}R\where R=(\braket{e_i,v_j})_{1\le i\le j\le n}$$Here $R$ is an upper triangular matrix, whose construction follows from the fact that $$\span(e_i:1\le i\le k)=\span(v_i:1\le i\le k),\quad\forall1\le k\le n$$This is essentially a QR decomposition ([[Matrix Decomposition]]).
