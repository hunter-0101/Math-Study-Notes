Given two [[Vector Space]] $X,Y$ and a dual system $(X,Y,b)$, the **weak topology** on $X$ induced by some $S\subset Y$, denoted as $\sigma(X,S,b)$, is the initial topology ([[Continuous Function]]) on $X$ induced by the collection of pairings $$f_y(x)=b(x,y),\quad\forall y\in S$$This topology is locally convex and is generated by the family of semi-norms $\{p_y\}_{y \in S}$ where $p_y(x) = |b(x, y)|$. When $S=Y$, this is typically referred to as the weak topology on $X$ with respect to the pairing $b$. 
- **Comparison of topologies induced by different subsets**: by [[Continuous Function]] we have $$\sigma(X,S,b)\subset\sigma(X,T,b)\qiffq T\subset S$$Intuitively, adding functions that are required to be continuous would naturally force the topology to be coarser. 
- **Hausdorff Property**: The topology $\sigma(X, S, b)$ is Hausdorff if and only if $S$ **separates points** in $X$, i.e., if $b(x, y) = 0$ for all $y \in S$, then $x = 0$.
- **Local Convexity**: By construction, $(X, \sigma(X, S, b))$ is a locally convex [[Topological Vector Space]], as its topology is induced by a family of semi-norms.
- **Weak Representation Theorem**: For a dual system $(X, Y, b)$, a linear functional $\ell: X \to F$ is continuous with respect to $\sigma(X, Y, b)$ if and only if there exists some $y \in Y$ such that $\ell(x) = b(x, y)$ for all $x \in X$.
    - In symbolic terms: $(X, \sigma(X, Y, b))^* \cong Y$ (under the identification via $b$).
- **Bounded Subsets**: A subset $A \subset X$ is $\sigma(X, Y, b)$-bounded if and only if $b(A, y) = \{b(x, y) : x \in A\}$ is a bounded set in $F$ for every $y \in Y$.
- **Comparison of Topologies**: If $S_1 \subset S_2 \subset Y$, then $\sigma(X, S_1, b) \subset \sigma(X, S_2, b)$, meaning the topology becomes finer as the set of testing elements $S$ increases.
### Professional Toolbox: Duality Theory
The following tools are essential for handling problems where the space $X$ does not have a natural norm, but possesses a well-defined dual pairing (e.g., distribution theory or weak-star topologies on measure spaces).
#### 1. Polar and Bipolar Sets
For a dual system $(X, Y, b)$ and a subset $A \subset X$, the polar $A^\circ \subset Y$ is defined as: $$A^\circ = \{y \in Y : |b(x, y)| \le 1, \forall x \in A\}$$
- **Tool (Bipolar Theorem)**: The bipolar $A^{\circ\circ} \subset X$ is the $\sigma(X, Y, b)$-closed convex hull of $A \cup \{0\}$. This is the primary tool for characterizing the weak closure of convex sets using dual information.
#### 2. The Mackey-Arens Theorem
This theorem classifies all locally convex topologies $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ that are **compatible** with the dual system (meaning $(X, \mathcal{T})^* = Y$).
- **Insight**: Any such topology $\mathcal{T}$ satisfies $\sigma(X, Y, b) \subset \mathcal{T} \subset \tau(X, Y, b)$, where $\tau(X, Y, b)$ is the **Mackey topology** (the topology of uniform convergence on $\sigma(Y, X, b)$-compact convex sets).
- **Application**: This allows you to switch between different topologies (like the weak and the Mackey topology) without changing the set of continuous linear functionals.
#### 3. Standard Dual Systems in Analysis
To apply these abstract results, one identifies $b$ with standard operations.
- **Normed Spaces**: $(V, V^*, \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle)$ where $b(v, \ell) = \ell(v)$.
- **Hilbert Spaces**: $(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{H}, \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle)$ where $b(u, v) = \langle u, v \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}$.
- **Function Spaces**: $(L^p, L^q, \int)$ where $b(f, g) = \int fg \, d\mu$.
