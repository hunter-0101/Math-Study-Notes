Given [[Vector Space]] $V$ over [[Field]] $F$, an **invariant subspace** o $T\in\mathcal L(V)$ is a subspace $$W\subset V\qstq T(W)\subset W$$The collection of $\mathcal T$-invariant subspaces given $\mathcal T\subset\mathcal L(V)$ is denoted $\lat(\mathcal T)$.
- **[[Lattice]] structure**: $\lat(\mathcal T)$ forms a lattice for $\mathcal T\subset\mathcal L(V)$.
  **Proof**: for $T\in\mathcal L(V)$ it's obvious that $\lat(T)$ is closed under linear span and intersection, hence $(\lat,\span_F,\cap)$ is a lattice. For $\mathcal T\subset\mathcal L(V)$ just notice that $$\lat(\mathcal T)=\bigcap_{T\in\mathcal T}\lat(T)$$and utilize the property that intersection of lattices with the same head $V$ and tail $\set{0}$ is still a lattice with the same meet and joint operator.
- **Cyclic subspace decomposition**: given some $v\in V$, the smallest invariant subspace of $T$ containing $v$ is given by $$\braket{v}_T=\span(v,Tv,T^2v,\cdots)$$by investigating the basis ([[Vector Space]]) of a subspace we can show that every invariant subspace is a sum (not necessarily direct) of cyclic subspace.
## Finite dimensional case
Given an operator $T$ on $\dim V<\infty$ its [[Jordan Normal Form]] is usually the main tool for problems involving invariant subspaces.
- **[[Module]]-theoretic interpretation**: since $V$ is naturally a module over $F[T]$ the [[Polynomial Ring]], while invariant subspaces are precisely the $F[T]$-submodules, the classification of such modules is given by the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over PID: $V$ decomposes uniquely (up to isomorphism) into a direct sum of cyclic modules of the form $$F[T]/(p_i(T))$$where $p_i(x)$ are the invariant factors.
## Worked example
> Consider the [[Symmetric Group]] $S_n$ as a collection of operators on $\mathbb R^n$ by permutation of coordinates, find all $S_n$-invariant subspaces.
- **Direct deduction**: we only consider non-trivial invariant subspaces. Obviously the space $$\set{r\cdot(1,\cdots,1)^T:r\in\mathbb R}$$is an invariant subspace, and when an subspace $W$ contains an element whose coordinates are not all the same we can easily deduce that $$e_i-e_{i+1}\in W,\quad\forall 1\le i\le n-1$$hence the only $S_n$-invariant subspace left is $$W=\span(e_{i}-e_{i+1}:1\le i\le n-1)$$
- **Symmetrization perspective**: firstly notice that $$\sym x=\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\sigma x=k(1,\cdots 1)^T,\quad\forall x\in V$$hence any $S_n$-invariant subspace must either contains $(1,\cdots,1)$ or not, and in later case since $$\sym\circ\sym=n!\sym\quad\Longrightarrow\quad P=\frac{1}{n!}\sym\text{ is a projection}$$we know that the subspace myst be contained in the orthogonal complement of $\span((1,\cdots,1))$. The rest is similar to the first proof.
## Other info
- **Invariant subspace problem**: it remains partially unsolved whether every bounded [[Operator on Hilbert Space]] on a complex [[Banach Space]] sends some non-trivial closed subspace to itself.
