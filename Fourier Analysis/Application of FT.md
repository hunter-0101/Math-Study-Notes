## Time-Frequency analysis
**Time-Frequency duality**: Notice that $\mathcal F[1]=\delta,\mathcal F[\delta]=1$. Intuitively speaking:
- **Delta basis**: $\int_\mathbb Rf(x)\delta(t)dx$ directly **amplifies** the value of $f$ at $t$ while **suppressing** everywhere else, returning the value information back.
- **Fourier basis** $\int_\mathbb R fe^{-2\pi i\xi x}dx$ **amplifies** the hidden harmonic component that resonate with it, and **cancels out** every other harmonics.
In terms of vector space, two transforms utilize two different orthogonal basis of domain of information: $\set{\delta(t)}_{t\in\mathbb R}$ for time domain, and $\set{e^{2\pi i\xi x}}_{\xi\in\mathbb R}$ for frequency domain, to construct the **time-frequency representation plane**, while Fourier transform serves as a rotation matrix converting between them.
- **Wavelet transform**: a wavelet is a family of functions $\Psi(t)$ satisfying **admissibility condition** ($\int_\mathbb R\Psi(t)dt=0$) and **finite energy** ($\int_\mathbb R|\Psi(t)|^2dt<\infty$). Define $\Psi_{a,b}=\Psi(\frac{t-b}{a})$, then the transform $T(a,b)$ at $(a,b)$ is the contribution of $\Psi_{a,b}$ to comprise the signal $$T(a,b)=\int_\mathbb Rf(t)\Psi_{a,b}(t)dt$$where $a,b$ are frequency and time axis respectively. Morlet wavelet: $\Psi(t)=ke^{i\omega_0t}\cdot e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}}$.
- **Short time Fourier transform (STFT)**: given a window function $w(\tau)$, we define $$\operatorname{STFT}[f(x)](\tau,\xi)=X(\tau,\xi)=\int_\mathbb Rf(x)w(x-\tau)e^{-2\pi i\xi x}dx$$where $w(\tau)$ is a bell-shaped kernel with compact support centered around zero (say, Gaussian window). The inverse formula is $$f(x)=\int_\mathbb R\int_\mathbb RX(\tau,\xi)e^{2\pi i\xi x}d\tau d\xi$$which is easy to obtain. It can be shown that this transform also preserves energy.

## Uncertainty principle
- **Uncertainty principle**: for a function $f\in L^2(\mathbb R)$ we have $$\left(\int_\mathbb Rx^2|f(x)|^2dx\right)\left(\int_\mathbb R\xi^2|\hat f(\xi)|^2d\xi\right)\ge\frac{\|f\|_{L^2}^4}{16\pi^2}$$ where equality is attained for $f(x)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{2}}{\sqrt\sigma}\exp(-\pi\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}),\sigma>0$ (normalized to $\|f\|_{L^2}=1$).
  **Proof**: since $\mathcal F\set{f'}=2\pi i\xi\hat f(\xi)$, square-integrability of $|\xi\hat f(\xi)|$ implies that $f'\in L^2$, thus $f$ is absolutely continuous (by Cauchy-Schwarz). Using integration by parts we have $$2\Re\int_\mathbb Rxf(x)\overline{f'(x)}dx=x|f(x)|^2\bigg|_{-\infty}^\infty-\int_\mathbb R|f(x)|^2dx=-\int_\mathbb R|f(x)|^2dx$$Now by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have $$\|f\|_{L^2}^4\le4\left(\int_\mathbb Rx^2|f(x)|^2dx\right)\left(\int_\mathbb R|f'(x)|^2dx\right)=16\left(\int_\mathbb Rx^2|f(x)|^2dx\right)\left(\int_\mathbb R\xi^2|\hat f(\xi)|^2d\xi\right)$$This completes the proof. Equality holds when there exists $\gamma\in\mathbb R$ such that $f'=-2\gamma xf(x)$, and by solving this we get $f(x)=C\exp(-\gamma x^2)$.
