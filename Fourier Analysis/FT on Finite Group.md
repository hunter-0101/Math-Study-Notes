## FT on abelian group
By [[Group]] it's known that $G$ is a $$\hat{\hat G}$$
## FT on non-abelian group
Given the definition of dual group in [[Group Representation]], we define FT on any finite group as $$\hat f(\rho)=\sum_{g\in G}f(g)\rho(g),\quad\forall\rho\in\hat G$$
- **Intuition**: under above settings a character is just a $1$-dimensional representation, and
