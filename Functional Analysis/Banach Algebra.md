An associative algebra ([[Ring]]) possessing a sub-multiplicative norm ([[Vector Space]]) is called a **normed algebra**. When the norm is complete we further call it a **Banach algebra** ([[Banach Space]]). Below we assume that $A,\Gamma$ is a Banach algebra, with multiplicative identity denoted as $e$.
- **Norm structure**: norm of a Banach algebra is not unique, however by sub-multiplicativity we must have $\|e\|\ge1$. For non-uniqueness, notice that given $(A,\|\cdot\|)$ a Banach algebra and $t\ge 1$ we have $(A,t\|\cdot\|)$ also a Banach algebra.
- **Structure of $A^\times$**: for any $\|t\|<1$ we have $$(e-t)^{-1}=e+t+t^2+\cdots$$which can be verified directly via completeness. It's easy to deduce that for $t\in A^\times$ we have $$s\in A^\times,\quad\forall s\in A,\|s-t\|<\|t^{-1}\|^{-1}$$by looking at $s=s-t+t=t(e-t^{-1}(t-s))$. Hence $A^\times$ is **open**.
	- If $A^\times=A\backslash\set{0}$ then $A$ is isometrically isomorphic to $\mathbb C$ as a Banach algebra.
	  **Proof**: let $h(\alpha)=\alpha e,\alpha\in\mathbb C$, then if $t\in A\backslash h(\mathbb C)$ we have $\alpha e-t\in A^\times,\forall\alpha\in\mathbb C$, which implies $\sigma(t)=\varnothing$, contradiction fundamental theorem of [[Spectrum]]. It suffices to verify that $h$ is a linear isometry with $h(\alpha\beta)=h(\alpha)h(\beta)$, which are obvious.
		- **Norm**: in this case by $\mathbb C$-linearity the norm is determined by $\|e\|=t\ge1$.
## Ideal
For **commutative** Banach algebra $\Gamma$, a subset $\Lambda\subset\Gamma$ is called an **ideal** if it's both a vector subspace ([[Vector Space]]) and a [[Ring]] ideal.
- **Basic properties**
	- **Proper/maximal idea**: the definitions are the same as [[Ideal]], and many results carries over here, e.g., every proper idea is contained in a unique maximal ideal.
	- **Closure**: if $\Lambda$ is an ideal, so is $\overline\Lambda$. Hence every maximal idea is closed in $\Gamma$.
	  **Proof**: $\overline\Lambda$ is a vector subspace by completeness, and is an ideal by similar reasoning.
	- **Quotient by maximal ideal**: for $\Lambda$ maximal, the quotient space $\Gamma/\Lambda$ is a commutative Banach algebra w.r.t natural operations and quotient norm $\|t+\Lambda\|=\inf_{s\in A}\|s+t\|$. This can be verified directly from definition.
	- **Union of maximal ideals**: denote $\mathcal M_I(\Gamma)=\set{\text{all maximal ideals of }\Gamma}$, then $$\mathcal M_I(\Gamma)\neq\varnothing,\quad\bigcup_{\Lambda\in\mathcal M_I(\Gamma)}\Lambda=\Gamma\backslash\Gamma^\times$$which is obvious by similar reasoning as in [[Ideal]].
- **Relation with multiplicative functional**: $\phi\in\Gamma\backslash\set{0}$ is called **multiplicative** if $\phi(st)=\phi(s)\phi(t)$. Denote the collection of multiplicative functionals as $\mathcal M_F(\Gamma)$, then the map $\phi\mapsto\ker\phi$ is a bijection from $\mathcal M_F(\Gamma)$ to $\mathcal M_I(\Gamma)$.
  **Proof**: given $\phi\in\mathcal M_F(\Gamma)$ clearly $\ker\phi$ is a proper [[Ideal]], and if $\ker\phi\subsetneq\Lambda\subset\Gamma$ is an ideal we can pick $t\in\Lambda\backslash\ker\phi$, then notice that $$\phi(t)e\in\Gamma^\times,\quad\phi(t)e=\phi(t)e-t+t\in\ker\phi+\Lambda\in\Lambda\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\Lambda=\Gamma$$Hence $\ker\phi$ is maximal. Moreover, given $\phi\neq\psi$ we pick $\phi(t)\neq\psi(t)$, then $$t-\phi(t)e\in\ker\phi\backslash\ker\psi\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\ker\phi\neq\ker\psi$$Hence $\phi\mapsto\ker\phi$ is injective. Finally given any $\Lambda\in\mathcal M_I(\Gamma)$, denote $\tilde\Gamma=\Gamma/\Lambda$ with $\pi$ the natural projection, then by maximality we have $$\tilde t\tilde\Gamma=\tilde\Gamma,\quad\forall\tilde t\in\tilde\Gamma\backslash\set{0}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad{\tilde\Gamma}^\times=\tilde\Gamma\backslash\set{0}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\tilde\Gamma\cong\mathbb C$$by some simple verification, hence we can identify $\pi\in\mathcal M_F(\Gamma)$, and clearly $\ker\pi=\Lambda$.o
### Examples
- **Continuous function**: assume that $K$ is compact Hausdorff ([[Separation Axioms]]), and consider the commutative Banach algebra $\Gamma=C(K,\mathbb C)$.
	- **Maximal ideal**: $\Lambda\subset\Gamma$ is a maximal ideal iff there exists $a\in K$ s.t. $$\Lambda=\set{f\in C(K,\mathbb C):f(a)=0}$$**Proof**: denote the above as $\Lambda_a$, then obviously $\Lambda_a\not\subset\Lambda_b,\forall a\neq b$ by Urysohn lemma ([[Separation Axioms]]). Now it suffices to show that any proper idea is contained in some $\Lambda_a$. Assume otherwise that some $\Lambda\in\mathcal M_I(\Gamma)$ is not of the form, then for each $a\in K$ we can pick $f_a\in\Lambda,f_a(a)\neq0$, and by continuity the non-zeroing domain can be enlarged to a open set $a\in U_a$. Now $\set{U_a}_{a\in K}$ forms a open cover of $K$, hence by compactness ([[Topological Space]]) a finite sub-cover $\set{(f_n,U_n)}$ can be picked. Let $$f=\sum_{n}|f|^2=\sum_n f\overline f$$then $f\in\Gamma^\times$, which implies $\Lambda=\Gamma$, a contradiction.
	- **Closed ideal**: $\Lambda\subset\Gamma$ is closed proper iff there exists non-empty closed $A\subset K$ s.t. $$\Lambda=\set{f\in C(K,\mathbb C):f(A)=\set{0}}$$**Proof**: obviously the previously defined $\Lambda_A$ is a closed proper ideal. Converse given closed proper ideal $\Lambda$ we denote $$A=\set{a\in K:f(a)=0,\forall f\in\Lambda},\quad\Lambda_A=\set{f\in C(K,\mathbb C):f(A)=\set{0}}$$then $A$ is closed non-empty by continuity, and $\Lambda_A$ is a closed proper ideal with $\Lambda\subset\Lambda_A$, hence it suffices to show $\Lambda_A\subset\Lambda$. Since $\Lambda$ is closed we consider to show that given any $h\in\Lambda_A,\varepsilon>0$ there exists $g\in\Lambda$ s.t. $\|h-g\|<\varepsilon$. For $\delta>0$ let $U_\delta=\set{a\in K:|h(a)|<\delta}$ be an open neighborhood of $A$, then for $\varepsilon$ small enough by Urysohn lemma there exists $$g_1\in C(K,\mathbb C)\quad\text{s.t.}\quad g_1(K)\subset[0,1],\quad g_1(\overline{U_\varepsilon})=\set{0},g_1(K\backslash U_{2\varepsilon})=\set{1}$$Also, for each $a\in K\backslash U_\varepsilon$ there exists $f_a\in\Lambda,f_a(a)\neq0$, hence as in the previous result we can obtain $g_2\in\Lambda$ with $g_2(K\backslash U_\varepsilon)\subset (0,\infty)$. By Tietze extension theorem ([[Separation Axioms]]) there exists $g_3\in C(K,\mathbb C)$ s.t. $g_3=1/g_2$ on $K\backslash U_\varepsilon$. Take $g=g_1g_2g_3h\in\Lambda$, then we get $\|h-g\|\le 2\varepsilon$ since $(g_1g_2g_3)(U_{2\varepsilon})\subset[0,1]$, and $g_1g_2g_3\equiv1$ on $K\backslash U_{2\varepsilon}$.
