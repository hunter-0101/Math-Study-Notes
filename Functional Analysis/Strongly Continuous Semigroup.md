Given $V$ a [[Banach Space]], a **strongly continuous semigroup** is a family of operators $$\set{T(t)}_{t\ge0}\where T(t)\in\mathcal B(V)$$satisfying three conditions:
1. **Semigroup property**: $T(t+s)=T(t)T(s),\forall t,s\ge0$ with $T(0)=I$, that is, it forms a semi-[[Group]] under the operator composition.
2. **Strong continuity**: for any $v\in V$ the map $t\mapsto T(t)v$ is continuous on $[0,\infty)$.
3. **Uniform boundedness**: there exists $M\ge1,\omega\in\mathbb R$  s.t. $$\|T(t)\|\le Me^{\omega t},\quad\forall t\ge0$$this is also referred to as the growth condition.
A strongly continuous semigroup is called a **$C_0$-semigroup**. It's a generalization of [[Exponential Function]], providing the solution of linear constant coefficient ODE in Banach spaces.
- **Intuition & motivation**: the primary intuition is that $T(t)$ represents the **evolution operator** acting on the state space $X$. If $x$ is the initial state of a system (e.g., a temperature distribution or a wave function), then $T(t)x$ is the state of the system at time $t$. The semigroup property $T(t+s) = T(t)T(s)$ reflects the fact that evolving for time $t+s$ is the same as evolving for time $s$ and then for time $t$. The goal of the theory is to provide a comprehensive solution to the abstract Cauchy problem (ACP): $$\frac{du}{dt} = A u(t), \quad u(0) = x$$The solution is given by $u(t) = T(t)x$. 
- **Infinitesimal generator**: the infinitesimal generator $A$ of the $C_0$-semigroup $T(t)$ is defined on its domain $D(A)$ as $$A x = \lim_{t \to 0^+} \frac{T(t)x - x}{t}$$The operator $A$ is typically an **unbounded operator** (meaning $D(A)$ is a proper subspace of $X$) and is the central object of study. For $T(t)$ to solve the ACP, its generator $A$ must be densely defined ($\overline{D(A)} = X$) and closed.
## Relation with Laplace transform
The [[Laplace Transform]] of the semigroup $T(t)$ is exactly the resolvent operator $R(\lambda, A)$ (as defined in [[Spectrum]]), provided $\Re(\lambda)$ is sufficiently large. Specifically, for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $\text{Re}(\lambda) > \omega$, where $\omega$ is the growth bound of the semigroup, the transform exists and is given by: $$R(\lambda, A) x = \int_0^\infty e^{-\lambda t} T(t) x \, dt, \quad \text{for all } x \in X$$This identity transforms the time evolution (multiplication of semigroups: $T(t)T(s)$) into an algebraic relationship in the complex domain (the resolvent identity).
- **Hille-Yosida Theorem**: a densely defined, closed operator $A$ on a Banach space $X$ is the generator of a $C_0$-semigroup $T(t)$ satisfying $||T(t)|| \le M e^{\omega t}$ if and only if the half-plane $(\omega, \infty) \subset \rho(A)$, and or all $\lambda > \omega$ and for every integer $n \ge 1$ we have $$\| R(\lambda, A)^n \| = \| (\lambda I - A)^{-n} \|\le \frac{M}{(\lambda - \omega)^n}$$The theorem uses the Laplace transform structure of the resolvent to establish a condition for the existence of the corresponding time-evolution operator $T(t)$.
### Applications & extensions
The Laplace transform connection enables powerful analytical techniques that are otherwise inaccessible.
- **Spectral Theory:** The spectrum of the generator, $\sigma(A) = \mathbb{C} \setminus \rho(A)$, determines the asymptotic behavior of the semigroup. The identity connects the two: for any $t \ge 0$, the spectrum of the operator $T(t)$ is related to the spectrum of the generator by $\sigma(T(t)) = \overline{\{e^{\lambda t} : \lambda \in \sigma(A)\}}$.
- **The Inversion Formula:** Just as the Laplace transform can be inverted for functions, the semigroup can be recovered from its resolvent using the **Mellin inversion formula**: $$T(t) x = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \lim_{\beta \to \infty} \int_{\gamma - i\beta}^{\gamma + i\beta} e^{\lambda t} R(\lambda, A) x \, d\lambda$$where $\gamma$ is any real number such that $\gamma > \omega$. This complex contour integral demonstrates the depth of the algebraic relationship between $A$ and $T(t)$.
- **Contraction Semigroups (Lumer-Phillips Theorem):** In the special case where $M=1$ and $\omega=0$ ($||T(t)|| \le 1$), the semigroup is a **contraction semigroup**. The Lumer-Phillips theorem provides an elegant and simpler characterization for the generator $A$ in terms of **dissipativity** (an inner product condition) and **range inclusion** (existence of the resolvent for a single $\lambda$).
In conclusion, the Laplace transform is not merely a computational tool but a conceptual bridge, transforming the challenge of solving evolution equations into the more manageable problem of characterizing the resolvent operator in the complex domain.
