The **weak topology** on a [[Normed Vector Space]] $V$ is defined as the [[Weak Topology]] $$\sigma(V,V^*)=\sigma(V,V^*,\braket{\cdot,\cdot})\where\braket{v,\ell}=\ell(v)$$which is induced by its [[Topological Dual Space]] and canonical pairing. Equivalently by definition, it's characterized by the notion of **weak convergence** ([[Topological Space]]) $$v_n\wto v\quad\iff\quad\ell(x_n) \to \ell(v)\quad \forall \ell \in V^*$$This topology is generated by the family of semi-norms ([[Normed Vector Space]]) $p_\ell(v) = |\ell(v)|$ for $\ell \in V^*$. 
- **Uniqueness of Limit**: if $v_n \wto u$ and $v_n \wto w$, then $u=w$.
  **Proof**: if $u \neq w$, by the separating property ([[Topological Dual Space]]) there exists $\ell \in V^*$ s.t. $\ell(x) \neq \ell(y)$, making convergence to both impossible.
- **Boundedness**: every weakly convergent sequence is bounded in norm, as a direct result of UBP ([[Banach Space]]).
- **Finite-dimensional space**: for $\dim V < \infty$ we have the equivalence $$x_n \rightharpoonup x \iff x_n \to x$$**Proof**: $(\Leftarrow)$ is obvious by continuity of functional. Conversely, in finite dimensions, coordinate-wise convergence (weak) implies norm convergence.
- **Closed convex sets**: A convex subset ([[Convexity]]) $C \subset V$ is strongly closed if and only if it is weakly closed. This is a powerful tool for proving existence in optimization; while weak convergence is "easier" to obtain, Mazur's Lemma allows us to recover strong limits within convex hulls.
- **Weak vs. strong topology**: weak convergence allows for "hidden" energy or oscillations that do not vanish in norm but vanish when tested against smooth probes (functionals).
	1. **Oscillation (The $L^2$ perspective)**: In $L^2([0, 2\pi])$, let $f_n(x) = \sin(nx)$. As $n \to \infty$, $f_n \rightharpoonup 0$ because the high-frequency oscillations average out against any fixed $L^2$ test function (Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma). However, $\|f_n\|_2 = \sqrt{\pi} \not\to 0$.
	2. **Concentration (The $\ell^p$ perspective)**: In $\ell^p$ ($1 < p < \infty$), the standard basis $e_n$ (vectors with $1$ at index $n$ and $0$ elsewhere) converges weakly to $0$ because each coordinate projection $\ell \in (\ell^p)^*$ sees the "mass" move to infinity. Yet, $\|e_n\|_p = 1$ for all $n$.
## Weak* Topology
For the [[Topological Dual Space]] $V^*$, we define the weak* topology $\sigma(V^*, V)$ similarly as the weak topology induced by $V^{**}$ and the canonical pairing. Equivalently by definition, it's characterized by the notion of **weak* convergence** $$\ell_n\wsto\ell\quad\iff\quad\ell_n(v) \to \ell(v), \quad \forall v \in V$$
- **Hierarchy of topologies on $V^*$**: we have the following relations: $$\sigma(V^*,V)\subset\sigma(V^*,V^{**})\subset\text{Strong (Norm) topology}$$The weak and weak* topologies coincide if and only if $V$ is reflexive ($J(V) = V^{**}$).
- **Banach-Alaoglu Theorem**: The closed unit ball $B_{V^*} = \{\ell \in V^* : \|\ell\| \le 1\}$ is compact in the weak* topology. This is the most critical compactness result for dual spaces, as it holds regardless of the reflexivity of $V$.
- Lower Semi-Continuity of the Norm: The norm is lower semi-continuous with respect to both weak and weak* convergence: $$\ell_n \xrightarrow{w^*} \ell \implies \|\ell\| \le \liminf_{n\to\infty} \|\ell_n\|$$
- **Metrizability**: If $V$ is separable, the weak* topology on the unit ball $B_{V^*}$ is metrizable. This implies that bounded sequences in $V^*$ have weak* convergent subsequences (sequential compactness).
