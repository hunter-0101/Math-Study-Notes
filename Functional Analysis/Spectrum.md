**Interesting problems**: 
1. How to explain the decomposition in Green's function method in [[Variation of Parameters]]?
	- Green's function is actually the resolvent function of differential operator?
2. How to interpret the coincidence between different methods for solving [[Linear ODE]]?

**Discussion**: in this note we're mainly interested in the general properties of the spectrum of operators, hence instead of looking at one specific operator we're focus on the algebraic structure formed by the collection of operators, and proceed under this holistic perspective. It's worth mentioning that the discussion below actually applies to any Banach Algebra over $\mathbb C$ with $\|e\|=1$.

---
Given a [[Banach Space]] $V$ (or more generally, an TVS) over $\mathbb C$, the collection of operators on $V$ forms a **[[Banach Algebra]]** under the [[Operator]] norm, which is denoted $\Gamma$. For an operator $t\in\Gamma$ we define its **resolvent set** and **spectrum** as $$\rho(t)=\set{\lambda\in\mathbb C:\lambda e-t\in\Gamma^\times},\quad\sigma(t)=\mathbb C\backslash\rho(t)$$Note that in a general $V$ injectivity does not imply invertibility, and for this reason we define spectrum using units ([[Ring]]) rather than [[Set Theory]] injectivity.
- **Further refinement**: $\sigma(T)$ is further refined based on the way $\lambda e-t$ fails to be invertible: 
	- **Point spectrum**: $\lambda e-t$ might not be injective, i.e. $$\sigma_p(t)=\set{\lambda\in\mathbb C:\ker(\lambda e-t)\neq\varnothing}$$This is the direct generalization of [[Eigendecomposition]] for finite dimensional [[Vector Space]]. A simple examples of operator without eigenvalue is $T:\ell^2\to\ell^2$ via right shift.
	- **Continuous spectrum**: $\lambda e-t$, although being injective, might not be surjective. In particular, when the image is a dense subset of $V$, i.e., $$\sigma_c(t)=\Set{\lambda\in\mathbb C:\ker(\lambda e-t)=\varnothing,\im(\lambda e-t)\neq V\text{ while }\overline{\im(\lambda e-t)}=V}$$In this case we have that $\lambda e-t$ is not bounded below.
	- **Residual spectrum**: any $\lambda$ other than the previous two cases is called a residual spectrum, that is, $\lambda e-t$ is injective, while its image is not dense in $V$, i.e., $$\sigma_r(t)=\Set{\lambda\in C:\ker(\lambda e-t)=\varnothing,\overline{\im(\lambda e-t)}\neq V}$$In this case the map $(\lambda e-t)^{-1}v\mapsto v$ does not admit a unique extension to a bounded linear map on all of $V$. 
  Putting the above three kinds of spectrums together, we have $$\sigma(t)=\sigma_p(t)\sqcup\sigma_c(t)\sqcup\sigma_{r}(t)$$Note that when $\lambda e-t$ does not have a dense image (injective or not) we also define such $\lambda$ as the compression spectrum, denoted $\sigma_{cp}(t)$.
- **Resolvent function**: given $t\in\Gamma$ define its resolvent function as $$R_t:\rho(t)\to\Gamma,\quad\alpha\mapsto(\alpha e-t)^{-1}$$which is holomorphic in the sense of [[Holomorphic Functional Calculus]] by the resolvent equation below. When the context is clear we can abbreviate $R_t$ as $R$.
	- **Resolvent equation**: we have $$R(\alpha)-R(\beta)=-(\alpha-\beta)R(\alpha)R(\beta),\quad\forall\alpha,\beta\in\rho(t)$$which is basically a manipulation of inverse pair: $$\begin{align}R(\alpha)-R(\beta)&=R(\alpha)(\beta e-t)R(\beta)-R(\beta)\\&=R(\alpha)(\alpha e-t+\beta e-\alpha e)R(\beta)-R(\beta)\\&=(e+(\beta-\alpha)R(\alpha))R(\beta)-R(\beta)\\&=(\beta-\alpha)R(\alpha)\end{align}$$
	- $d(\alpha,\sigma(t))\ge1/\|R(\alpha)\|,\forall\alpha\in\rho(t)$, because $B(\alpha e-t,1/\|R(\alpha)\|)\subset\Gamma^\times$ by estimation in [[Banach Algebra]], hence for $\beta\in\sigma(t)$ we have $|\beta-\alpha|=\|(\beta e-t)-(\alpha e-t)\|\ge 1/\|R(\alpha)\|$.
	- **Vanishing at infinity**: $\|R(\alpha)\|\to0$ as $|\alpha|\to\infty$, since we have $$\|R(\alpha)\|=|\alpha^{-1}|\|(e-t/\alpha)^{-1}\|\to0,\quad|\alpha|\to\infty$$alternatively we can also utilize sub-multiplicativity of norm with similar estimation.
- **Fundamental theorem of spectrum**: $\sigma(t)$ is a non-empty compact subset of $\mathbb C$ contained in $\overline{B(0,\|t\|)}$. For this reason we can define the **spectral radius** $$r(t)=\sup_{\lambda\in\sigma(t)}|\lambda|$$**Proof**: $\rho(t)$ is open by openness of $\Gamma^\times$ ([[Banach Algebra]]) and continuity of [[Operator]] norm, hence $\sigma(t)$, being its complement, is closed. The inclusion $\sigma(t)\subset\overline{B(0,\|t\|)}$ follows from the construction $$(\lambda e-t)^{-1}=\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\left(\frac{t}{\lambda}\right)^n$$Hence $\sigma(t)$ is compact. For non-emptiness, assuming $\sigma(t)=\varnothing$ we have $R_t$ entire, while it's bounded by the vanishing property, hence constant by Liouville's theorem ([[Holomorphic Functional Calculus]]), which is an obvious contradiction.
	- **Spectral radius formula**: we have $$r(t)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\|t^n\|^{1/n}=\inf_{n\in\mathbb N}\|t^n\|^{1/n}$$**Proof**: by the above inclusion and natural commutativity below we have $$r(t)=\left(r(t^n)\right)^{1/n}\le\|t^n\|^{1/n},\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$$which completes half of the proof, and by [[An Epsilon of Room]] it suffices to show $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}\|t^n\|^{1/n}\le a,\quad\forall a>r(t)\quad\iff\quad\|(t/a)^n\|<M,\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$$We now take $b>\max(a,\|t\|)$, and consider the following two annuluses $$A=\set{z\in\mathbb C:r(t)<|z|<b},\quad A_1=\set{z\in\mathbb C:\left\|t\right\|<|z|<b}$$Since $A\subset\rho(t)$ we have $R_t$ holomorphic on $A$, while on smaller $A_1$ completeness of $\Gamma$ ensures the following convergence ([[Banach Space]]): $$R_t(z)=\frac{(e-t/z)^{-1}}{z}=\frac{1}{z}\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}(t/z)^n\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\phi\circ R_t(z)=\frac{1}{z}\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\frac{\phi(t^n)}{z^n},\quad\forall\phi\in\Gamma^*$$By [[Holomorphic Function]] the Laurent series is still valid on $A$, in particular for $a\in A$. This convergence implies that $\phi(t^n)a^{-n}$ is bounded, and by arbitrariness of $\phi$ we have $(t/a)^n$ bounded via uniform boundedness principle ([[Banach Space]]).
- **Operator polynomial**: applying the theory of [[Polynomial Ring]] we can define $p\in\mathbb C[t]$.
	- **Natural commutativity**: $\sigma\circ p(t)=p\circ \sigma(t)$. 
	  **Proof**: the result for constant $p$ follows from linearity of $\sigma$, while for $\deg p\ge1$ we write $\alpha-p(z)=c\prod_{i=1}^n(z-\alpha_i)$ given $\alpha\in\mathbb C$, then by structure of $\Gamma^\times$ we have $$\alpha e-p(t)\in \Gamma^\times\quad\iff\quad\alpha_ie-t\in\Gamma^\times,\forall 1\le i\le n$$Hence by definition we have $\sigma\circ p=p\circ\sigma$.
		- **Corollary**: $p(t)\in\Gamma^\times\iff p$ has not zeroes in $\sigma(t)$, since by above we have $$p(t)\in\Gamma^\times\quad\iff0\quad\notin\sigma\circ p(t)=p\circ\sigma(t)$$which obviously yields the result.
		- **Spectrum for special operators**: the above result can be used to calculate spectrum of special operators, e.g., if $t^2=t$ we immediately know that $\sigma(t)^2-\sigma(t)=\sigma(0)=0$, hence $\sigma(t)=0$. Similarly if $t^k=0,k\in\mathbb N$ we have $\sigma(t)=0$.
## Examples 
- **Diagonal operator**: let $\set{e_n}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be an orthonormal basis of [[Hilbert Space]], and take $\set{\beta_n}\subset\mathbb C$ a bounded set. Define the diagonal operator $$T:\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\alpha_ne_n\mapsto\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\beta_n\alpha_ne_n\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sigma_p(T)=\set{\beta_n},\quad\sigma(T)=\overline{\set{\beta_n}}$$Here $\sigma_p(T)$ is quite obvious from definition, while to see $\sigma(T)$ we need to notice that $$T\in\gl(V)\quad\iff\quad\beta_n\neq0,\forall n\in\mathbb N\text{ and } 1/\beta_n\text{ bounded }\quad\iff\quad  0\notin\overline{\set{\beta_n}}$$similar argument applies to any $\lambda I-T$.
	- **Corollary**: given any compact $K\subset\mathbb C$ and a separable Hilbert space $X$ there exists $T\in\mathcal B(X)$ s.t. $\sigma(T)=K$. It suffices to pick a countable dense subset of $K$ and construct the diagonal operator taking point spectrum on the dense subset of $K$.
- **Multiplication operator**: let $(Y,\mu)$ be a $\sigma$-finite [[Measure]] space and fix $g\in L^\infty(Y)$. Define $$T:L^2(Y)\to L^2(Y),\quad f\mapsto gf$$then we have $$\sigma_p(T)=\set{\lambda\in\mathbb C:\mu(g^{-1}(\lambda))>0},\quad\sigma(T)=\set{\lambda\in\mathbb C:\mu(g^{-1}(B(\lambda,\varepsilon)))>0,\forall\varepsilon>0}$$which is obvious by similar consideration.
- **Weight shift operator**: given $\set{w_n}\subset\mathbb C$ bounded define the operator by $$T:\ell^2(\mathbb N)\to\ell^2(\mathbb N),\quad(x_0,x_1,\cdots)\mapsto(w_1x_1,w_2x_2,\cdots)$$Then obviously $T\in\mathcal K\iff w_n\to0$. For operator norm we have $$\|T^n\|=\sup_{k\in\mathbb N}|w_kw_{k+1}\cdots w_{k_n-1}|$$This implies that $r(T)=0$, hence $\sigma(T)=\set{0}$. 
## Other info
- **Support of spectral resolution**: for $f\in\mathcal H$ the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure corresponding to $F(\lambda)=\braket{E(\lambda)f,f}$ is supported on $\sigma(T)$.
  **Proof**: it's equivalent to say that $F(\lambda)$ is constant on any open interval of $\mathbb R\backslash\sigma(T)$. Take any open interval $J\in\mathbb R\backslash\sigma(T),x_0\in J$, and a sub-interval centered at $x_0$ of length $2\varepsilon$ with $$\varepsilon<\|(T-x_0I)^{-1}\|$$If $\Im z_0\neq0$ then $(T-zI)^{-1}$ is given by $\Phi(T)$ where $\Phi(t)=(t-z)^{-1}$. Hence $(T-zI)^{-1}(T-\overline zI)^{-1}$ is given by $\Psi_z(T)$ where $\Psi_z(t)=|t-z|^{-2}$. Apply the spectral theorem to $\Psi$ we get $$\int\frac{dF(\lambda)}{|\lambda-z|^2}\le A',\quad\forall|z-x_0|<\varepsilon$$Now integrate the above expression on $x\in J_0$ we get $\int_{J_\varepsilon}dF(\lambda)=0$, hence $F(\lambda)$ is constant on $J_\varepsilon$. By arbitrary-ness of $x_0$ we know that $F(\lambda)$ is constant throughout $J$, hence the result follows.
- **Gelfand's formula**: for any $T\in\mathcal B(\mathcal H)$ we have $r(T)=\lim_{k\to\infty}\|T^k\|^{1/k}$.
  **Proof**: 
	- **Intuition**: the key is that, when repeatedly apply $T$ the rate at which it stretches vectors (in the worst case) converges to the spectral radius.
