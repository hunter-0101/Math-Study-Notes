A **proper hyperplane** of a [[Vector Space]] $V$ over [[Field]] $F$ can be defined equivalently as:
1. The subspace $\ker\ell$ for some $\ell\in V^\#$ the [[Algebraic Dual Space]]. 
2. A maximal proper linear subspace.
3. A proper linear subspace $W\subset V$ with $\codim W=1$.
Translates of proper hyperplane are called **affine hyperplanes**, which we'll abbreviated simply as a hyperplane. 
- **Motivation**: in [[Euclidean Space]] $\mathbb R^2$ a line is generally given by $$ax+by=c,\quad a,b,c\in\mathbb R$$and similarly in $\mathbb R^3$ a plane is given by $$ax+by+cz=d,\quad a,b,c,d\in\mathbb R$$the shared idea is that, a "plane" should be a translate of a linear subspace specified by a linear constraint, e.g. a subspace that takes the general form $$\braket{x,a}=\sum_{\alpha\in I}a_\alpha x_\alpha=\beta,\quad a\in F^I,\beta\in F$$where $F$ is the underlying [[Field]]. Now in a general [[Vector Space]] (without coordinate) it makes sense to utilize the bracket expression, generalized into a duality pair, to represent a generalized notion of hyperplane: $$\braket{v,f}=c,\quad c\in F$$and that's exactly how the above definition rises naturally. 
	- **Convexity of the unit ball**: by definition of norm of functionals we have the inequality $$\left|\braket{x,f}\right|\le\|x\|\cdot\|f\|\quad\iff\quad\Braket{\frac{x}{\|x\|},f}\le\|f\|$$Geometrically, it says that the unit ball in a Banach space is convex ([[Convexity]]). 
- **Basic properties**
	- **Closedness**: a hyperplane determined by a **continuous** functional ([[Topological Dual Space]]) is closed, which follows directly from continuity ([[Point Set Topology]]).
	- **Density**: a hyperplane determined by a **discontinuous** (equivalently, unbounded) functional is dense in $V$. To see this, by unboundedness there exists $\set{v_n}$ with $$\lim_{n\to\infty}v_n=0\quad\text{while}\quad \ell(v_n)=1,\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$$now for any $u\in V$ we have that $u-\ell(u)v_n\in\ker\ell$, hence such sequence that takes $u$ as the limit point is constructed. 
## Geometric Hahn-Banach theorem
Below we assume that $V$ is a [[Normed Vector Space]] $F=\mathbb R$ (or any totally ordered field with Archimedean property ([[Real Number System]]). This is necessary for the depiction of separation via comparing values of a linear functional at different points. 
**Separation of convex sets (geometric HBT)**: for $0\in K\subset V$ a convex ([[Convexity]]) and open subset and some $v_0\notin K$ there exists $\ell\in V^*,a\in\mathbb R$ s.t. $$\ell(v_0)\ge a,\quad\ell(K)\subset(-\infty,a)$$**Proof**: consider the **Minkowski's gauge function** defined as $$p(v)=\inf\Set{r>0:\frac{v}{r}\in K}$$then we can verify that $p(v)$ is a seminorm ([[Normed Vector Space]]) with $$p(v)\le1,\quad\forall v\in K\quad\text{and}\quad p(v_0)\ge1$$Now we define a functional "orthogonal" to $v_0$ via $$\ell_0(\lambda v_0)=\lambda p(v_0),\quad\forall\lambda\in\mathbb R$$then $\ell_0(v)\le p(v),\forall v\in\span(v_0)$ by definition, hence by HBT ([[Algebraic Dual Space]]) it admits an extended $\ell$ with $\ell\le p$. Now the hyperplane $H_\ell^1=\set{\ell(v)=1}$ is exactly the hyperplane separating $K$ and $v_0$. For boundedness of $\ell$ just notice that by openness there exists $\delta>0$ s.t. $$B(0,\delta)\subset K\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\frac{\delta v}{2\|v\|}\in B(0,\delta),\quad\forall v\in V\quad\Longrightarrow\quad p(v)\le\frac{2\|v\|}{\delta}$$hence $p$ is bounded, and by domination of $\ell$ by $p$ we know that $\ell\in V^*$.
