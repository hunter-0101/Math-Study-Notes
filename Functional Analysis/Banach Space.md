A **Banach space** is a complete ([[Metric Space]]) [[Normed Vector Space]] $(V,\|\cdot\|)$. It's the foundation of further studies in [[Hilbert Space]], and bears some interesting properties in itself. In this note all vectors spaces are assumed to be Banach unless stated explicitly. 
- **Separability**: $V$ is separable if t's separable as a [[Metric Space]].
	- **Identification as [[Lp Space]]**: given $V$ separable there exists operator $i\in\mathcal L(V,L^\infty(\mathbb Z))$ s.t. $\|i(f)\|_{L^\infty(\mathbb Z)}=\|f\|_V$. Further there exists surjection $P\in\mathcal L(L^1(\mathbb Z),V)$ s.t. $$\|P(x)\|_V=\inf_{y\in\mathcal S}\|x+y\|_{L^1(\mathbb Z)},\quad\forall x\in L^1(\mathbb Z)\quad\text{where}\quad\mathcal S=\set{x\in L^1(\mathbb Z):P(x)=0}$$That is, $V$ can also be identified as $L^1(\mathbb Z)/\mathcal S$.
	  **Proof**: take $\set{f_n}\subset V$ a dense subset, and let $\ell_n\in V^*$ s.t. $\|\ell_n\|=1,\ell_n(f_n)=\|f_n\|$ by corollary of HBT ([[Topological Dual Space]]). Now we can define $$i(f)=(\ell_n(f))_{n\in\mathbb Z},\quad\forall f\in V$$which is obviously linear with norm equivalence. For the second identification just let $$P(x)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}\frac{x_nf_n}{\|f_n\|}$$
## Linear operators on Banach space
Banach space inherits all definitions and basic properties of  **linear operator** from [[Normed Vector Space]]. We'll mainly focus on properties that are special to Banach spaces. 
- **Uniform boundedness principle (UBP)**: assume $V$ Banach and $W$ [[Normed Vector Space]]. Consider $\mathcal T\subset\mathcal B(V,W)$ we have the following implication: $$\sup_{T\in \mathcal T}\|Tv\|_W<\infty,\forall v\in V\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sup_{T\in \mathcal T}\|T\|_{\mathcal B(V,W)}<\infty$$**Proof**: consider the subset sequence $$V_n=\Set{v\in V:\sup_{T\in \mathcal T}\left\|Tv\right\|_W\le n}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}V_n=V\neq\varnothing$$while each $V_n$ is closed by continuity and [[Set Theory]]. By Baire category theorem there exists $V_m$ containing an interior point, i.e., $\overline{B(v_0,\varepsilon)}\subset V_m$. Now for any $v\in V,\|v\|\le 1$ we have $$\|T(v)\|_W=\varepsilon^{-1}\|T(v_0+\varepsilon v)-T(v_0)\|_W\le2\varepsilon^{-1}m$$taking the supremum over $\|v\|=1,T\in \mathcal T$ yields the result.
	- **Alternative proof**: notice a simple fact that for $T\in\mathcal B(V,W)$ we have $$\sup_{v'\in B(v,r)}\|Tv'\|\ge\|T\|r,\quad\forall v\in V,r>0$$as a simple application of triangle inequality ([[Vector Space]]). Assume $\sup_{T\in \mathcal T}\|T\|=\infty$ and pick $\|T_n\|\ge 4^n$. Set $v_0=0$, and use the fact to inductively choose $v_n\in V$ s.t. $$\|v_n-v_{n-1}\|\le3^{-n}\quad\text{while}\quad \|T_nv_n\|\ge\frac{2}{3}3^{-n}\|T_n\|$$Now $\set{v_n}$ is Cauchy, hence converges to $v\in V$ by completeness, while $$\|x-x_n\|\le\frac{1}{2}3^{-n}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\|T_nx\|\ge\frac{1}{6}3^{-n}\|T_n\|\ge\frac{1}{6}3^{-n}4^n\to\infty$$which is a contradiction. 
	- **Intuition**: we need completeness because without it, the space can be a countable union of very "thin" closed sets, and we can hide the unboundedness of the operator norms on different tiny parts so that each fixed vector sees only finitely many large operators (hence pointwise bounded), while the operator norms themselves blow up.
	- **Counterexample**: consider the following space with uniform norm $$V=\Set{x=(x_1,x_2,\cdots):\sup_{n\in\mathbb N}\left|nx_n\right|<\infty},\quad \|x\|=\sup_{n\in\mathbb N}|x_n|$$then the space is not complete (consider $e_n$), and if we let $T_n(x)=nx_n$ it's obvious that the sequence $T_n(e_n)$ is unbounded. 
- **Open mapping theorem**: surjective $T\in\mathcal B(V,W)$ is an open map ([[Topological Space]]). 
  **Proof**: the image of an open ball in $B_1$ centered at zero must contain an open ball in $B_2$ centered at zero (otherwise contradicting the surjective condition). For arbitrary open set a shift and scaling is enough to yield the result.
	- **Corollary**: if $T\in\mathcal B(B_1,B_2)$ is bijective, then $T^{-1}\in\mathcal B(B_2,B_1)$.
	- **Closed graph theorem**: for linear  but not necessarily  bounded $T:B_1\to B_2$, $T\in\mathcal B(B_1,B_2)$ iff the graph of $T$, defined as $$\Gamma(T)=\set{(u,Tu):u\in B_1}$$is closed in $B_1\times B_2$, a Banach space with norm $\|(b_1,b_2)\|=\|b_1\|+\|b_2\|$. Note that this is equivalent to the open mapping theorem. 
## Series in Banach space
Consider a series $\set{v_k}$ in a Banach space $V$.
- **Convergence**: $\sum v_k$ converges if the series $\Set{\sum_{k=1}^nv_k}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges in the sense of [[Metric Space]]. If $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \|v_k\|<\infty$ then we say it's **absolutely convergent**.
	- **Cauchy property**: convergent series is equivalent to Cauchy property, since we're assuming completeness in Banach space. [[Metric Space]]
- **Characterization of completeness**: a normed vector space $V$ is complete iff $$\sum\|v_n\|<\infty\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sum v_n=v\in V$$**Proof**: for $\Leftarrow$, notice that given any $\set{v_n}$ Cauchy we can pick a list of index $n_k$ s.t. $$d(v_m,v_n)<2^{-k},\quad\forall m,n>n_k\quad\Longrightarrow\quad \|v_{n_{k+1}}-v_{n_k}\|<2^{-k},\quad\forall k$$hence $\sum\|v_{n_{k+1}}-v_{n_k}\|<\infty$, allowing us to define $v=\sum(v_{n_{k+1}}-v_{n_k})$ by assumption, while the uniqueness of limit follows easily from Cauchy property ([[Metric Space]]); for $\Rightarrow$ we have that $\sum_{k=1}^nv_k$ is Cauchy by triangle inequality ([[Vector Space]]), hence the limit $v=\sum_{n}v_k$ exists by assumption. 
	- **Intuition**: an absolutely convergent sequence is inherently Cauchy as discussed above, and the above equivalence essentially says that weakness of Cauchy property (contains more elements than needed) can by remedied by uniqueness of limit point, so that two are actually indistinguishable under the perspective of limit.
	- **Discussion**: the above statement actually relies on the completeness of $\mathbb R$ ([[Real Number System]]) as a bridge between two statements. More specifically, for $\Leftarrow$ the key step is to find an absolutely convergent subsequence for a Cauchy sequence, and the key result in this process, $\sum 2^{-k}=1$, is not purely algebraic, but relies on completeness of $\mathbb R$. Without completeness the construction may end up with a norm estimate outside $\mathbb R$, for which the second statement cannot be applied.
