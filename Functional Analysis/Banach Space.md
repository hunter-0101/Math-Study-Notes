A **Banach space** is a complete ([[Metric Space]]) [[Normed Vector Space]] $(V,\|\cdot\|)$. It's the foundation of further studies in [[Hilbert Space]], and bears some interesting properties in itself. In this note all vectors spaces are assumed to be Banach unless stated explicitly. 
- **Separability**: $V$ is separable if t's separable as a [[Metric Space]].
	- **Identification as [[Lp Space]]**: given $V$ separable there exists operator $i\in\mathcal L(V,L^\infty(\mathbb Z))$ s.t. $\|i(f)\|_{L^\infty(\mathbb Z)}=\|f\|_V$. Further there exists surjection $P\in\mathcal L(L^1(\mathbb Z),V)$ s.t. $$\|P(x)\|_V=\inf_{y\in\mathcal S}\|x+y\|_{L^1(\mathbb Z)},\quad\forall x\in L^1(\mathbb Z)\quad\text{where}\quad\mathcal S=\set{x\in L^1(\mathbb Z):P(x)=0}$$That is, $V$ can also be identified as $L^1(\mathbb Z)/\mathcal S$.
	  **Proof**: take $\set{f_n}\subset V$ a dense subset, and let $\ell_n\in V^*$ s.t. $\|\ell_n\|=1,\ell_n(f_n)=\|f_n\|$ by corollary of HBT ([[Topological Dual Space]]). Now we can define $$i(f)=(\ell_n(f))_{n\in\mathbb Z},\quad\forall f\in V$$which is obviously linear with norm equivalence. For the second identification just let $$P(x)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}\frac{x_nf_n}{\|f_n\|}$$
- **Other properties**: below we list some useful properties of Banach spaces.
	- **Closed subspace is also Banach**: given $V$ Banach and $W\subset V$ a closed subspace, by closeness any limit point of sequence of $W$ lies within $W$, including those being Cauchy, therefore $W$ is also Banach. 
## Linear operator
Banach space inherits all definitions and basic properties of **linear operator** from [[Normed Vector Space]]. We'll mainly focus on properties that are special to Banach spaces. 
- **Uniform boundedness principle (UBP)**: assume $V$ Banach and $W$ [[Normed Vector Space]]. Consider $\mathcal T\subset\mathcal B(V,W)$ we have the following implication: $$\sup_{T\in \mathcal T}\|Tv\|_W<\infty,\forall v\in V\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sup_{T\in \mathcal T}\|T\|_{\mathcal B(V,W)}<\infty$$**Proof**: consider the subset sequence $$V_n=\Set{v\in V:\sup_{T\in \mathcal T}\left\|Tv\right\|_W\le n}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb N}V_n=V\neq\varnothing$$while each $V_n$ is closed by continuity and [[Set Theory]]. By Baire category theorem there exists $V_m$ containing an interior point, i.e., $\overline{B(v_0,\varepsilon)}\subset V_m$. Now for any $v\in V,\|v\|\le 1$ we have $$\|T(v)\|_W=\varepsilon^{-1}\|T(v_0+\varepsilon v)-T(v_0)\|_W\le2\varepsilon^{-1}m$$taking the supremum over $\|v\|=1,T\in \mathcal T$ yields the result.
	- **Alternative proof**: notice a simple fact that for $T\in\mathcal B(V,W)$ we have $$\sup_{v'\in B(v,r)}\|Tv'\|\ge\|T\|r,\quad\forall v\in V,r>0$$as a simple application of triangle inequality ([[Vector Space]]). Assume $\sup_{T\in \mathcal T}\|T\|=\infty$ and pick $\|T_n\|\ge 4^n$. Set $v_0=0$, and use the fact to inductively choose $v_n\in V$ s.t. $$\|v_n-v_{n-1}\|\le3^{-n}\quad\text{while}\quad \|T_nv_n\|\ge\frac{2}{3}3^{-n}\|T_n\|$$Now $\set{v_n}$ is Cauchy, hence converges to $v\in V$ by completeness, while $$\|x-x_n\|\le\frac{1}{2}3^{-n}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\|T_nx\|\ge\frac{1}{6}3^{-n}\|T_n\|\ge\frac{1}{6}3^{-n}4^n\to\infty$$which is a contradiction. 
	- **Intuition**: we need completeness because without it, the space can be a countable union of very "thin" closed sets, and we can hide the unboundedness of the operator norms on different tiny parts so that each fixed vector sees only finitely many large operators (hence pointwise bounded), while the operator norms themselves blow up.
	- **Counterexample**: consider the following space with uniform norm $$V=\Set{x=(x_1,x_2,\cdots):\sup_{n\in\mathbb N}\left|nx_n\right|<\infty},\quad \|x\|=\sup_{n\in\mathbb N}|x_n|$$then the space is not complete (consider $e_n$), and if we let $T_n(x)=nx_n$ it's obvious that the sequence $T_n(e_n)$ is unbounded. 
- **Open mapping theorem**: surjective $T\in\mathcal B(V,W)$ is an open map ([[Continuous Function]]). 
  **Proof**: by surjectivity and boundedness, given $\delta_W>0$ there exists $\delta_V>0$ s.t. $$B_W(0,\delta_W)\subset T(B_V(0,\delta_V))$$Now for any $w=T(v)\in T(A),A\in\mathcal T_V$ we pick $\varepsilon_W>0$ small enough s.t. $B_W(w,\varepsilon_w)\subset T(A)$, then by linearity we can perform a scaling and translation to yield $$B_W(w,\varepsilon_W)\subset T\left(B_V\left(v,\frac{\varepsilon_W}{\delta_W}\delta_V\right)\right)$$which implies that any $w\in T(A)$ is an interior point of $T(A)$, hence $T(A)$ is open. By arbitrariness of $A$ we know that $T$ is an open map. 
	- **Banach inverse theorem**: if $T\in\mathcal B(V,W)$ is bijective, by the open mapping theorem $T^{-1}$ is an open map, hence continuous (by definition of [[Continuous Function]]), which further implies that $T^{-1}\in\mathcal B(V,W)$. 
		- Without completeness of $W$ it might happen that $T^{-1}$ is not bounded, for instance, $$T:C([0,1])\to C^1([0,1]),\quad Tf(x)=\int_0^x f(t)dt\imply T^{-1}=\frac{d}{dx}$$here differentiation is obviously unbounded in the norm on $C^1$ ([[Sobolev Space]]).
	- **Closed graph theorem**: given $T\in\mathcal L(V,W)$ we have that $T\in\mathcal B(V,W)$ iff its graph $$\Gamma(T)=\set{(v,Tv):v\in V}$$is closed in $V\times W$, a Banach space with norm $\|(v,w)\|_{V\times W}=\|v\|_V+\|w\|_W$. 
	  **Proof**: $(\Rightarrow)$ is quite trivial by boundedness, thus continuity of $T$, noticing that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}(v_n,Tv_n)\to(v,Tv)\quad\iff\quad \lim_{n\to\infty} v_n=v,\quad\lim_{n\to\infty} Tv_n=Tv$$For $(\Leftarrow)$, since $(V\times W,\|\cdot\|_{V\times W})$ is Banach and $\Gamma(T)$ is a closed subspace of it, we have $(\Gamma(T),\|\cdot\|_{V\times W})$ also being Banach. Consider the projections $\pi_V,\pi_W$ from $V\times W$ to $V,W$, then since $\pi_V|_{\Gamma(T)}$ is bijective by Banach inverse theorem we have $(\pi_V|_{\Gamma(T)})^{-1}$ being also continuous, therefore $$T=\pi_W\circ(\pi_V|_{\Gamma(T)})^{-1}$$is also continuous, hence bounded. 
		- **Intuition**: imagine a function $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, then it's obvious that the graph $$\Gamma(f)=\set{(x,f(x)):x\in\mathbb R}$$is closed iff $f\in C(\mathbb R)$, since continuity ensures that various kinds of pedagogical discontinuity do not show up. This intuition is generalized to the CGT. 
## Series in Banach space
Consider a sequence $\set{v_k}$ in a Banach space $V$.
- **Convergence**: $\sum v_k$ converges if the series $\Set{\sum_{k=1}^nv_k}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges in the sense of [[Metric Space]]. If $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \|v_k\|<\infty$ then we say it's **absolutely convergent**.
	- **Cauchy property**: convergent series is equivalent to Cauchy property, since we're assuming completeness in Banach space. [[Metric Space]]
- **Characterization of completeness**: a normed vector space $V$ is complete iff $$\sum\|v_n\|<\infty\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sum v_n=v\in V$$**Proof**: for $\Leftarrow$, notice that given any $\set{v_n}$ Cauchy we can pick a list of index $n_k$ s.t. $$d(v_m,v_n)<2^{-k},\quad\forall m,n>n_k\quad\Longrightarrow\quad \|v_{n_{k+1}}-v_{n_k}\|<2^{-k},\quad\forall k$$hence $\sum\|v_{n_{k+1}}-v_{n_k}\|<\infty$, allowing us to define $v=\sum(v_{n_{k+1}}-v_{n_k})$ by assumption, while the uniqueness of limit follows easily from Cauchy property ([[Metric Space]]); for $\Rightarrow$ we have that $\sum_{k=1}^nv_k$ is Cauchy by triangle inequality ([[Vector Space]]), hence the limit $v=\sum_{n}v_k$ exists by assumption. 
	- **Intuition**: an absolutely convergent sequence is inherently Cauchy as discussed above, and the above equivalence essentially says that weakness of Cauchy property (contains more elements than needed) can by remedied by uniqueness of limit point, so that two are actually indistinguishable under the perspective of limit.
	- **Discussion**: the above statement actually relies on the completeness of $\mathbb R$ ([[Real Number System]]) as a bridge between two statements. More specifically, for $\Leftarrow$ the key step is to find an absolutely convergent subsequence for a Cauchy sequence, and the key result in this process, $\sum 2^{-k}=1$, is not purely algebraic, but relies on completeness of $\mathbb R$. Without completeness the construction may end up with a norm estimate outside $\mathbb R$, for which the second statement cannot be applied.
