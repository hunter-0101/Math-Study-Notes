**Commutative** [[Ring]] $R$ is called an **integral domain** if it contains no nonzero zero divisor.
- **Law of cancelation**: the law of cancelation holds for integral domain, since $$ar=br\quad\iff\quad (a-b)r=0\quad\iff\quad a-b=0$$in the last equality we used the fact that $r\neq0$.
- **Associates**: $a,b$ in $R$ are associates if $a\mid b,b\mid a$. The association is obviously an equivalence relation ([[Set Theory]]).
- **Irreducibility**: take $p$ a nonzero non-unit, then $p$ is said to be irreducible if $p=xy$ implies $x\in R^*$ or $y\in R^*$.
- **Prime**: $p\in R$ is prime if $p\mid xy$ implies $p\mid x$ or $p\mid y$, i.e., $(p)$ is prime given $R$ commutative.
	- **Relation between irreducibility and primeness**: in an integral domain and $p$ a nonzero non-unit we have that $(p)$ maximal implies $p$ prime, which further implies $p$ irreducible. When $R$ is a PID then the above three conditions are equivalent.
- **GCD domain**: a GCD domain is an integral domain in which any two elements has a GCD, i.e., there is a unique principle ideal containing the ideal generated by two given elements.
	- **Unique factorization domain (UFD)**: 
	- **PID is GCD domain**: by definition ([[Ideal]]), any ideal in a PID is a principal ideal, hence PID is naturally a GCD domain.
	- **Ideal-intersection criterion**: $R$ is a GCD domain iff (finite) intersection of principal ideals is a principal ideal. In particular, $(a)\cap (b)=(c)$ where $c=\lcm(a,b)$.
