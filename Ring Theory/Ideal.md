Given a [[Ring]] $(R,+,\cdot)$ an **ideal** is a subset $I\subset R$ s.t.:
1. **Subgroup structure**: $(I,+)\le(R,+)$
2. **Absorption property**: $RI\subset I,IR\subset I$. When only one hold, we call it left/right ideal. 
We sometimes use $\mathfrak{a,b,c}$, etc. to denote ideals. Note that an ideal is not necessarily a subring ([[Ring]]) since we have $1\notin I$ in non-trivial cases. 
- **Arithmetic operations**: given ideals $I,J$ the following sets are all ideals: $$\begin{align}I+J&=\set{a+b:a\in I,b\in J}\\ I\cdot J&=\Set{\sum_{i=1}^{<\infty}a_ib_i:a_i\in I,b_i\in J}\\ I\cap J&=\set{x:x\in I,x\in J}\end{align}$$since group structure and absorption property are preserved under theses operations. Note that for commutative $R$ we have $IJ=I\cap J$.
- **Quotient ring**: for two-sided ideal $I$ in $R$ define the quotient ring of $R$ modulo $I$ by $$R/I=R/\sim\quad\text{where}\quad r\sim s\iff r-s\in I,\quad\forall r,s\in R$$with operations given similarly to that in [[Group]] by $$(r+I)+(s+I)=(r+s)+I,\quad (r+I)\cdot(s+I)=(r\cdot s)+I$$By absorption property $R/I$ is subring of $R$.
	- **Isomorphism between ideals**: let $\mathbb L_I(R)$ be ideals of $R$ containing $I$, then the mapping $$\Phi_I:(\mathbb L_I(R),\subset)\to(\mathbb L(R/I),\subset),\quad\Phi(J)=J/I$$is an isomorphism.
	  **Proof**: by the properties of [[Ring]] we can verify that $\Phi$ is bijective. Now for $J_1,J_2\in\mathbb L_I$ we have $J_1\subset J_2\Leftrightarrow J_1/I\subset J_2/I$, which is enough to show that $\Phi$ is isomorphism.
- **Ideal generated by $S$**: for subset $S\subset R$ we define the ideal generated by $S$ as $$(S)=\Set{\sum_{i=1}^{<\infty}r_is_it_i:r_i,t_i\in R,s_i\in S}=RSR$$We can $S$ a **system of generators** of $(S)$. Any $\mathfrak a=(a),a\in R$ is called **principal ideal**.
	- **Principal ideal domain (PID)**: $R$ is a PID if it's an integral domain ([[Ring]]) and all its ideals are principal ideals. 
		- **Principle ideal ring**: without the domain condition we say it's a PIR, in which case we usually also need to specify **principle left (right) ideal ring**
	- **Identical principal ideals**: for $\mathfrak a=(a),\mathfrak b=(b)$ in commutative integral domain $R$, we have $\mathfrak{a=b}$ iff there exists $c\in R^*$ s.t. $b=ca$.
- **Prime ideal**: an ideal $\mathfrak p\subsetneq R$ is prime if $\mathfrak{ab\subset p}$ implies $\mathfrak{a\subset p}$ or $\mathfrak{b\subset p}$ for any two ideals $\mathfrak{a,b}$.
	- **Prime ideal in commutative ring**: for $R$ commutative this is equivalent to the condition that $ab\in\mathfrak p$ implies $a\in\mathfrak p$ or $b\in\mathfrak p$ for any $a,b\in R$. It suffices to apply the result on $(a),(b)$.
	- **Prime ideal in commutative ring**: for $R$ commutative it's obvious that $\mathfrak p$ is prime iff $R/\mathfrak p$ is an integral domain ([[Ring]]).
- **Maximal ideal**: an ideal $\mathfrak m$ is maximal if $\mathfrak m\subsetneq I\subset R$ implies $I=R$.
	- **Maximal idea in commutative ring**: for $R$ commutative $\frak m$ is maximal iff $R/\frak m$ is a [[Field]].
	- **Krull's theorem**: in a non-zero ring $R$ (with an identity), any proper ideal is contained in some maximal ideal.
		- **Proof**: let $I$ be an ideal and let $S$ be the set of ideals containing $I$. Now $(S,\subset)$ is a poset. For any chain $C$ within the poset we let $J=\bigcup_{A\in C}A$, then it can be verified that $J$ is also an ideal. As any proper ideal does not contain $1$, any chain has a upper bound, thus by Zorn's lemma $S$ has a maximal element, which is a maximal (proper) ideal containing $I$. [[Order]]
	- For commutative $R$, $R/I$ is a field iff $I$ is maximal. Further, the ideal under quotient ring is maximal/prime/radical iff the original ideal is maximal/prime/radical.
		- **Proof**: easy to verify with the isomorphism between $\mathbb L_I(R)$ and $\mathbb L(R/I)$.
## Coprime ideal
Two ideals $H,N$ are said to be **coprime** if $H+N=R$. The name is in the sense that there exists $h\in H,n\in N$ such that $h+n=1$.
- **Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)**: for pairwise coprime two-sided proper ideals $I_k$ in $R$, let $$\phi:R\left/\bigcap_{k=1}^nI_k\right.\to\prod_{k=1}^nR/I_k,\quad x\bmod \bigcap_{k=1}^nI_k\mapsto(x\bmod I_1,\cdots,x\bmod I_n)$$Then $\phi$ is an isomorphism.
  **Proof**: consider the mapping $$\phi:R\to\prod_{k=1}^nR/I_k,\quad\phi(x)=(x+I_1,\cdots,x+I_n)$$It can be verified that $\phi$ is a homomorphism with $\ker\phi=\bigcap_{k=1}^nI_k$, and further notice that $$\begin{align}R&=I_1+R^2=I_1+(I_1+I_2)(I_1+I_3)\\&\subset I_1+I_1^2+I_1I_3+I_2I_1+I_2I_3\\&\subset I_1+(I_2\cap I_3)\end{align}$$continue as above we can show that $I_k+\bigcap_{s\neq k}I_s=R$, hence for any $r_k\in R$ we can pick $$r_k=x_k+y_k\in I_k+\bigcap_{s\neq k}I_s\quad\Longrightarrow\quad r=\sum_{k=1}^nx_k\equiv r_k\pmod{I_k},\quad\forall k$$Hence $\phi(r)=(r_1+I_1,\cdots,r_n+I_n)$, proving surjectivity. By the first isomorphism theorem ([[Ring]]) $\phi$ induces an isomorphism $\varphi:R/\ker\phi\to \im\phi$ as desired.
	- **Counterexample**: coprime-ness is necessary. A simple counterexample is $$\mathbb Z/24\mathbb Z\not\cong(\mathbb Z/8\mathbb Z)\times(\mathbb Z/12\mathbb Z)$$since they're both finite with different number of elements. A more complex example is $$\mathbb Z[X]/(X^2-cX)\not\cong\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z,\quad\forall c\in\mathbb Z_{\ge2}$$Here absence of  coprime-ness can be seen from $1\notin(X)+(X-c)$. 
	- **CRT for PID**: since any ideal in a PID is principle we know that any two ideals in PID are coprime, hence the condition for CRT can be weakened to distinct ideals. More can be found in [[Other Algebra Tools]].
	- **Discussion on commutativity of $R$**: the theorem does not require $R$ to be commutative, and the proof actually relies on the fact that $I_k+R^2=R,\forall k$, which is implied by $1\in R$ in definition ([[Ring]]). However if we're dealing with rng then the theorem may not be valid.
## Radical
In commutative $R$, the **radical** of an ideal $I$, denoted $rad(I)$, is defined as $$\rad(I)=\set{r\in R:r^n\in I\text{ for some }n\in\mathbb Z^+}$$Intuitively, $rad(I)$ is obtained by taking all roots of elements of $I$ within the ring.
- Equivalently, let $\phi:R\to R/I$ the canonical quotient map, then $rad(I)=\phi^{-1}(r(R/I))$.
- **Radical as intersection of prime ideals containing it**: we have that $$\rad(I)=\bigcap_{\mathfrak p\text{ prime},I\subset\mathfrak p\subset R}\mathfrak p$$This is because: a). all prime ideals are radical, thus the intersection contains $rad(I)$. b). choose $r\notin rad(I)$ and let $S=\langle r\rangle$, then $S\cap rad(I)=\varnothing$. By Krull's theorem there is a prime ideal $p$ such that $I\subset p,p\cap S=\varnothing$. This shown that $r$ is not in the intersection of prime ideals containing $I$, completing the proof.
- **Jacobson radical**: for a ring $R$, its Jacobson radical $J(R)$ is the intersection of all maximal left/right ideals. 
	- **$J(R)$ is an ideal of $R$**: we only need to show that $J(R)$ is a right ideal, i.e., $xr\in J(R),\forall x\in J(R),r\in R$. If $r\in m$ for some left maximal ideal $m$ then we're down; if there is a maximal left ideal $m$ such that $r\notin m$, then we let $m_0=\set{a\in R:ar\in m}$. It can be shown that $m_0$ is also a maximal left ideal, thus we must have $xr\in J(R)$.
	- **If $x\in J(R)$ then $1-x\in R^*$**: a non-unit element will always contained in some maximal left ideal, thus there must exists a $u$ with $u(1-x)=1$. Now we get $1-u=-ux\in J(R)$, thus by the same reasoning we have $v$ such that $vu=1\Rightarrow v=vu(1-x)=1-x$. Now we have $1=vu=(1-x)u=u(1-x)$, thus $1-x\in R^*$.
	- By a bit further discussion on the above property we get that $$J(R)=\set{x\in R:1-rx\in R^*,\forall r\in R}$$This is because for any maximal left ideal $m$ and $x\notin m$, we must have $m+Rx=R$ (otherwise LHS is also a proper ideal strictly containing the maximal ideal), thus there exists $y+rx=1$, then $y=1-rx=m\cap R^*\Rightarrow m=R$, a contradiction.
	- The above properties, combined together, shows that picking left or right ideal in the definition makes no difference.
	- If $R$ is Artinian, then $J(R)$ is nilpotent.
## Noetherian ring
A ring $R$ is said to be **(left-)Noetherian** if all its (left) ideals $I_n$ satisfies the **ascending chain condition**: every increasing $I_1\subset I_2\subset\cdots$ has a largest elements, e.g., $I_n=I_{n+1}=\cdots$.
- **Equivalent characterization**: $R$ is (left-)Noetherian if every (left) ideal is finitely generated. The equivalence is obvious.
