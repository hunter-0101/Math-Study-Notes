## Assigning values
This method is usually used when assigning values helps to interpret the condition in a more intuitive way, or transform it into something manageable by elementary math.

> Let $S_n=\set{1,2,\cdots,n}$ and $P=\varnothing$. Now update $P$ in the following way: in each step randomly choose an element in $T=S_n\backslash\set{x-1,x,x+1:x\in P}$, and add it into $P$. When no any element can be added into $P$, denote $X_n=|P|$. Let $E_n=E(X_n)$, calculate $\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{E_n}{n}$.
- **Rearrangement of order**: instead of choosing randomly from the seat, we take an arbitrary permutation $\sigma\in \Sigma_n$ and check in the order $\sigma_1\to\sigma_2\to\cdots\to\sigma_n$. In each checking, accept the legal index and skip the illegal ones. Since the seats with larger $\sigma_i$ are always checker after those with smaller $\sigma_i$, it's easy to notice that when we have an increasing sequence $\sigma_{i}<\sigma_{i+1}<\sigma_{i+2}<\cdots$, once $\sigma_i$ is chosen then so is $\sigma_{i+2k},k\in\mathbb N$.
- **Generalize to large $n$**: for $n$ really large the above model can be seen as equivalent to assigning a random value $\sigma(i)\in[0,1]$ to each seat $i$ (we don't worry about $\sigma(i)=\sigma(j)$ since it happens only on a set of measure zero). Like above, we look for the peak-shaped sequence, and deduce that seat $i$ will be chosen iff the peak has even length on both sides.
- **Calculation with formula**: to find the probability that $i$ is taken is equivalent to finding the probability that the sequence peaked at $i$ is of even length in both descending direction. Fix $x_i=x$ and consider only one side, then from Venn diagram the probability will be $$\begin{align}P'&=1-P(x_i>x_{i-1})+P(x_i>x_{i-1}>x_{i-2})-\cdots\\&=1-x+\frac{x^2}{2}-\frac{x^3}{6}+\cdots\\&=e^{-x}\end{align}$$Considering two sides, the probability will be $e^{-2x}$. Thus the overall expectation is $$\int_0^1e^{-2x}dx=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2e^2}$$
