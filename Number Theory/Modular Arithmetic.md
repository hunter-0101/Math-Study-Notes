Given $m\in\mathbb Z_{>1}$ called a **modulus**, two integers $a,b\in\mathbb Z$ being **congruent modulo $m$** is defined as $$a\equiv b\pmod m\quad\iff\quad m\mid a-b$$via [[Division]]. This is obviously an equivalence relation ([[Set Theory]]).
## Residual system
The **complete residual system** modulo $m\in\mathbb Z$ is defined as $$\mathbb Z_m=\mathbb Z/\sim_m\quad\text{where}\quad a\sim b\iff a\equiv b\pmod m$$In particular, $\set{0,1,\cdots,m-1}$ is called the least residual system modulo $m$. Any element in the system is called a **representative**. Note that this concept must be distinguished from the $p$-adic integers ([[p-adic Field]]), which is conventionally represented by the same symbol. 
- **[[Group]] structure**: obviously $(\mathbb Z/\sim_m,+(\bmod m))\cong(C_m,+)$ ([[Group Gallery]]), which is a cyclic group under addition modulo $m$.
	- **Residual system of coprime modulus**: by property of cyclic group ([[Group Gallery]]) for $\gcd(m,n)=1$ we have $\mathbb Z_m\times\mathbb Z_n=\mathbb Z_{mn}$, and this carries over to the residual system.
- **Reduced residual system**: we define the reduced residual system of $m$ as $$\mathbb Z_m^\times=\set{1\le n<m:(m,n)=1}$$obviously this set forms a [[Group]] under multiplication. The order of this set is defined as $\varphi(m)$, as defined in [[Arithmetic Function]].
## Primitive root modulo $m$
Consider the **multiplicative group of integers** modulo $m$, denoted $\mathbb Z_m^\times$ (which is the group of units in the [[Ring]] of integers modulo $m$). We can prove that $Z_m^\times$ is **cyclic** iff $$m=2,4,p^k,2p^k\quad\text{where}\quad p\in\mathbb P_{>2},k\in\mathbb Z_{\ge1}$$in such case any generator of the [[Group]] is called a **primitive root**.
- **Equivalent characterization**: $g\in\mathbb Z_m^\times$ is a primitive root iff $$\delta_m(g)=\varphi(m)$$where $\delta_m(g)$ is the order of $g$ modulo $m$ (order of element in the group). That is, it reaches the maximal possible order by Euler's theorem ([[Arithmetic Function]]). 
  **Proof of equivalence**: for $\Rightarrow$, when $\mathbb Z_m^\times$ is cyclic we know immediately that any generator must have order $\varphi(m)$. For $\Leftarrow$, since $\varphi(m)$, being the cardinality of the group, is the highest possible order, and is achieved only when $g$ is an generator ([[Group]]), which is just saying that $\mathbb Z_m^\times$ is cyclic. 
	- **Computational verification**: by Lagrange's theorem ([[Group]]) we have $\delta_m(g)\mid\varphi(m)$, hence to verify whether $g$ is a primitive root modulo $m$ it suffices to check whether $$g^d\not\equiv 1\pmod m,\quad\forall d\mid \varphi(m)$$Moreover, this can actually be simplified to $$g^{\varphi(m)/p}\not\equiv 1\pmod m,\quad\forall p\mid\varphi(m),p\in\mathbb P$$since once $\delta_m(g)<\varphi(m)$ we can always find a multiple of it of such form.
- **Number of primitive roots**: assuming that $m$ has primitive roots, then $$\#\set{g:\delta_m(g)=\varphi(m)}=\varphi(\varphi(m))$$where $\varphi(m)$ is the Euler totient function ([[Arithmetic Function]]). 
  **Proof**: given $g$ a primitive root, by order definition and generator definition we have $$\mathbb Z_m^\times=\braket{g}=\set{g,g^2,\cdots,g^{\varphi(m)}}$$then $g^k$ being another primitive root is equivalent to $(k,\varphi(m))=1$, by the Bézout's identity ([[Division]]), hence the number of primitive roots is exactly $\varphi(\varphi(m))$.
- **Index**: given modulus $m$ and primitive root $g$, the **index** of $a\in\mathbb Z_m^\times$ to the base $g$ is defined by $$a\equiv g^{\ind_g(a)}\pmod m$$the index exists and is unique modulo $\varphi(m)$ since $g$ is an generator of $\mathbb Z_m^\times$.
## Quadratic residue
Given $n\in\mathbb N$, and integer $a\in\mathbb N$ is a **quadratic residue** modulo $n$ if there exists $x\in\mathbb N$ s.t. $$x^2\equiv a\pmod n$$otherwise we call $a$ a **quadratic non-residue**. This is signified via the **Legendre symbol** $$\left(\frac{a}{n}\right)=\begin{cases}1,&\text{if } a\text{ is a quadratic residue modulo }n\\-1,&\text{if }a\text{ is a quadratic non-residue modulo }n\\0,&\text{if }a=0\end{cases}$$This concept can actually be generalized to any $k$-th residue, although that's less commonly used in other fields. In this section we assume that $p\in\mathbb P,p\ge3$, for which the Legendre symbol is obviously **$p$-periodic**. 
- **Euler's criterion**: for any $a\in\mathbb N$ we have $$\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)\equiv a^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\pmod p$$
- **Complete multiplicity**: for any $a,b\in\mathbb N$ we have $$\left(\frac{ab}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)$$This can be proved easily by writing $a,b$ as powers of a primitive root.
- **Quadratic reciprocity**: for any pair of distinct odd primes $p,q\in\mathbb P_{\ge3}$ we have $$\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)=(-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\cdot\frac{q-1}{2}}$$
