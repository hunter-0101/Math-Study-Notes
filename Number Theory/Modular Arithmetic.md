Given $m\in\mathbb Z_{>1}$ called a **modulus**, two integers $a,b\in\mathbb Z$ being **congruent modulo $m$** is defined as $$a\equiv b\pmod m\quad\iff\quad m\mid a-b$$via [[Division]]. This is obviously an equivalence relation ([[Set Theory]]).
## Residual system
The **complete residual system** modulo $m\in\mathbb Z$ is defined as $$\mathbb Z/\sim_m\quad\text{where}\quad a\sim b\iff a\equiv b\pmod m$$In particular, $\set{0,1,\cdots,m-1}$ is called the least residual system modulo $m$. Any element in the system is called a **representative**.
- **[[Group]] structure**: obviously $(\mathbb Z/\sim_m,+(\bmod m))\cong(\mathbb Z_m,+)$ ([[Group Gallery]]), which is a cyclic group under addition modulo $m$.
- **Reduced residual system**: we define the reduced residual system of $m$ as $$\set{1\le n<m:(m,n)=1}$$obviously this set forms a [[Group]] under multiplication. The order of this set is defined as $\varphi(m)$, as discussed in [[Arithmetic Function]].
## Primitive root modulo $m$
Consider the **multiplicative group of integers** modulo $m$, denoted $\mathbb Z_m^\times$ (which is the group of units in the [[Ring]] of integers modulo $m$). We can prove that $Z_m^\times$ is **cyclic** iff $$m=2,4,p^k,2p^k\quad\text{where}\quad p\in\mathbb P_{>2},k\in\mathbb Z_{\ge1}$$in such case any generator of the [[Group]] is called a **primitive root**.
- **Equivalent characterization**: $g\in\mathbb Z_m^\times$ is a primitive root iff $$\delta_m(g)=\varphi(m)$$where $\delta_m(g)$ is the order of $g$ modulo $m$ (order of element in the group). That is, it reaches the maximal possible order by Euler's theorem ([[Arithmetic Function]]). 
  **Proof of equivalence**: for $\Rightarrow$, when $\mathbb Z_m^\times$ is cyclic we know immediately that any generator must have order $\varphi(m)$. For $\Leftarrow$, since $\varphi(m)$, being the cardinality of the group, is the highest possible order, and is achieved only when $g$ is an generator ([[Group]]), which is just saying that $\mathbb Z_m^\times$ is cyclic. 
- **Number of primitive roots**: assuming that $m$ has primitive roots, then $$\#\set{g:\delta_m(g)=\varphi(m)}=\varphi(\varphi(m))$$where $\varphi(m)$ is the Euler totient function ([[Arithmetic Function]]). 
  **Proof**: given $g$ a primitive root, by order definition and generator definition we have $$\mathbb Z_m^\times=\braket{g}=\set{g,g^2,\cdots,g^{\varphi(m)}}$$then $g^k$ being another primitive root is equivalent to $(k,\varphi(m))=1$, by the Bézout's identity ([[Division]]), hence the number of primitive roots is exactly $\varphi(\varphi(m))$.
- **Index**: given modulus $m$ and primitive root $g$, the **index** of $a\in\mathbb Z_m^\times$ to the base $g$ is defined by $$a\equiv g^{\ind_g(a)}\pmod m$$the index exists and is unique modulo $\varphi(m)$ since $g$ is an generator of $\mathbb Z_m^\times$.
