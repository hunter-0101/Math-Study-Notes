A sequence $(s_1,s_2,\cdots)$ is called equidistributed on $[a,b]$ if for every $[c,d]\subset[a,b]$ we have $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}|\set{s_1,\cdots,s_n}\cap[c,d]|=\frac{d-c}{b-a}$$
- **Discrepancy**: the discrepancy $D_n$ for $(s_n)$ w.r.t $[a,b]$ is defined as $$D_n=\sup_{a\le c\le d\le b}\left|\frac{\set{s_1,\cdots,s_n}\cap[c,d]}{N}-\frac{d-c}{b-a}\right|$$hence by definition $(s_n)$ is equidistributed if $D_n\to0,n\to\infty$.
- **Riemann integral criterion**: $(s_n)$ is equidistributed on $[a,b]$ iff for every Riemann integrable $f$ on $[a,b]$ we have $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^nf(s_k)=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)dx$$the $\Leftarrow$ part is obvious by taking $f=\chi_{[c,d]}$, while the $\Rightarrow$ part follows from an estimation of Darboux sum ([[Riemann Integral]]) based on indicator function.
## Equidistribution modulo $1$
**Weyl's equidistribution theorem**: for $\gamma$ irrational, $\langle n\gamma\rangle(n\in\mathbb N)$ is equidistributed on $[0,1]$.
**Proof**: we first pro of an intermediate result: for $f:\mathbb T\to\mathbb C$ continuous we have $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n f(k\gamma)\to\int_\mathbb Tf(t)dt,\quad n\to\infty$$this can be shown using the [[Standard Mechanism]]. The result is obvious for $f(x)\equiv1$, and for $f(x)=\exp(2\pi inx)$ the expression reduces to a simple geometric series. Now by [[Fourier Series]] $f$ can be approximated uniformly, and the rest is the $3\varepsilon$. The original result follows from a sequence of continuous $f\to\chi_{[a,b]}$.
- **Key in proof**: the proof utilize Fourier series to proof a stronger result than equidistribution, but this result relies on the condition that $\gamma\notin\mathbb Q$, otherwise there are finitely many $\exp(2\pi inx)$ s.t. the summation equals $1$, making one of the $3\varepsilon$ explodes.
- **Generalization**: let $P$ be a polynomial with at least one coefficient (other than the constant term) irrational, then $P(n)$ is equidistributed modulo $1$.
- **Weyl's criterion**: $\set{a_n}$ is equidistributed modulo $1$ iff $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n\exp(2\pi ila_k)=0,\quad \forall l\in\mathbb N$$This is actually equivalent to integral criterion, based on density of trigonometric polynomial (Weierstrass approximation theorem).

## Power of irrational
It's still unknown what characterize those $\gamma$ s.t. $\langle \gamma^k\rangle$ is equi-distributed.
- **$\langle\gamma^k\rangle$ where $\gamma=(1+\sqrt5)/2$ is not equi-distributed**:a simple consideration of Fibonacci sequence shows that $\langle\gamma^{2k+1}\rangle\to0,\langle\gamma^{2k}\rangle\to1$.
