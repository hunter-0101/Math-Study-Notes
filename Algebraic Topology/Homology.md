## Simplex
The **standard $n$-simplex** is the convex hull ([[Convexity]]) of the standard basis $\set{e_0,\cdots,e_n}$ of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ $$\Delta^n=\Set{\sum_{i=0}^nt_ie_i:\sum_{i=1}^nt_i=1,t_i\ge0}$$Each $e_i$ is a **vertex** of the simplex, and $t_i$ are called **barycentric coordinates**. Given topological space ([[Topological Space]]) $X$ a **singular $n$-simplex** is a continuous $\sigma:\Delta^n\to X$. The set of all singular $n$-simplices is denoted $\Sin_n(X)$.
- **Examples**: a line or a circle is a $1$-simplex, and a disk or the surface of a ball is a $2$-simplex.
- **Face inclusion**: by sending vertices to vertices and omitting $e_i$ we define the inclusion map $$d^i:\Delta^{n-1}\to\Delta^n,\quad0\le i\le \binom{n}{n-1}=n$$By pre-composition we can further define $$d_i:\Sin_n(X)\to\Sin_{n-1}(X),\quad\sigma\mapsto\sigma\circ d^i,\quad0\le i\le n$$Intuitively this restricts $\sigma$ to the face corresponding to its $i$-th vertex.
- **Singular $n$-chain**: the abelian [[Group]] of singular $n$-chains in $X$ is the free abelian group ([[Free Group]]) generated by $n$-simplices: $$S_n(X)=\mathbb Z\Sin_n(X)$$We note define the boundary operator $$d:\Sin_n(X)\to S_{n-1}(X),\quad d\sigma=\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^id_i\sigma$$which extends to a homomorphism $d:S_n(X)\to S_{n-1}(X)$ by additivity.
- **Cycle & boundary**: define the set of $n$-cycles and boundaries as $$\begin{align}Z_n(X)&=\ker\left(d:S_n(X)\to S_{n-1}(X)\right)\\ B_n(X)&=\im\left(d:S_{n+1}(X)\to S_n(X)\right)\end{align}$$Notice that denoting $\delta(j)=\begin{cases}0,&j<i\\1,&j>i\end{cases}$ for re-indexing for boundary we have $$d^2\sigma=d\left(\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^id_i\sigma\right)=\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i\sum_{j\neq i}(-1)^{j-\delta(j)}d_jd_i\sigma=0$$Hence $B_n(X)\subset Z_n(X)$.
### Singular homology group
A **singular chain complex** is a graded ([[Exterior Algebra]]) abelian group $A=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}A_n$ together with homomorphisms $d:A_n\to A_{n-1}$ with the property $d^2=0$. By above we know that $$S_*(X)=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}S_n(X),\quad d:S_n(X)\to S_{n-1}(X)$$ is a singular chain complex. By [[Group]] quotient we define the **$n$-th singular homology group** as $$H_n(X)=\frac{Z_n(X)}{B_n(X)}$$Two chains in the same coset are said to be **homologous**.
