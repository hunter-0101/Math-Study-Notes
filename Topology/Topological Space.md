**Motivation**: in topology the key concept we wanna maintain is **nearness** between elements. This explains why we only require closedness under finite intersection, since infinite intersection might end up a singleton, and it makes no sense to say that a point it near itself. Meanwhile arbitrary  union is required because it's a desired property for **openness** (e.g., in $\mathbb R$, and more generally in [[Set]]).
- **General discussion**: the concept of "nearness in space" is rather widely applicable, hence making topology already applied in many other fields out of math, e.g., topological epistemology. 
- **Difference with [[Measure]] space**: for a measure space we require closedness under countable intersection, union, and complement, since they're desired properties to talk about the concept of **size** and its behavior under aforementioned operations.

--- 
A **topology** on a [[Set]] $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}\subseteq\mathcal P(X)$ having the following properties:
1. **Empty set & total set**: $\varnothing,X\in\mathcal{T}$. 
2. **Closedness under arbitrary union**: we have$$\bigcup_{A\in\mathcal A}A\in\mathcal{T},\quad\forall\mathcal A\subseteq\mathcal T$$This ensures that the collection of open sets behaves consistently with the intuitive notion of "openness" found in [[Metric Space]]. 
3. **Closedness under finite intersection**: we have $$\bigcap_{A\in\mathcal A}A\in\mathcal{T},\quad\forall\mathcal A\subseteq\mathcal T,\#\mathcal A<\infty$$We only require finite intersection mainly to avoid making a single point open. 
The pair $(X,\mathcal T)$ is called a **topological space**. Any subset $A\subseteq X$ is **open** if $A\in\mathcal{T}$, **closed** if its complement is open, and **clopen** if it's both open and closed. 
- **Lattice of topologies**: denote $\mathfrak T(X)$ the collection of all topologies on $X$, and define $$\mathcal T\land\mathcal S=\mathcal T\cap\mathcal S,\quad \mathcal T\lor\mathcal S=\bigcap_{\mathcal T,\mathcal S\subseteq\mathcal R\in\mathfrak T}\mathcal R$$Then $(\mathfrak T(X),\land,\lor)$ forms a complete [[Lattice]], which can be verified easily via definition. 
	- **Comparability**: for $\mathcal{T},\mathcal{S}\in\mathfrak T(X),\mathcal{T,S}\subseteq\mathcal{T}$, we say that $\mathcal{T}$ is **finer** than $\mathcal{S}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ is **coarser** than $\mathcal{T}$. These two topologies are said to be **comparable**. 
- **Structure of closed sets**: by duality between open and closed set, and the De Morgan's law ([[Set]]), the collection of closed set is closed under arbitrary intersection and finite union. We can actually specify a topology by specifying all closed sets satisfying the above properties. 
- **Subspace topology**: for topological space $(X,\mathcal{T}_X)$ and a subspace $Y\subseteq X$, the collection $$\mathcal{T}_Y=\Set{Y\cap U:U\in \mathcal{T}_X}$$ is a topology on $Y$, called the **subspace topology**. 
	- **Basis of subspace topology**: restriction of $\mathcal B_Y=\set{B\cap Y:B\in\mathcal T_X}$ is a basis for $\mathcal T_Y$.
	- **Relation with product topology**: for $A,B$ subspaces of $X,Y$, then the product topology $\mathcal T_{A\times B}$ is the same as the subspace topology that $A\times B$ inherits as a subspace of $X\times Y$.
	- **Inheritance of openness/closedness**: for $Y\subseteq X$, $B\in Y$ is open/closed iff $B=A\cap Y$ where $A\in X$ is open/closed.
## Basis of a topology
A **basis** of $\mathcal T$ on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal T$ satisfying $$\forall U\in\mathcal T\ \exists\mathcal B_U\subset\mathcal B\quad \st\quad U=\bigcup_{B\in\mathcal B_U}B$$Any subset $B\in\mathcal B$ is referred to as a **basis elements**. Note that basis of a topology is not unique, and the representation of open sets via basis elements is also not unique. 
- **Topology generated by a sub-collection of sets**: the topology generated by any sub-collection $\mathcal S\subseteq\mathcal P(X)$ is defined as $$\mathcal T(\mathcal S)=\bigcap_{\mathcal S\subseteq\mathcal T\in\mathfrak T(X)}\mathcal T$$Here $\mathcal S$ is referred to as a **subbasis** for $\mathcal T(\mathcal S)$, in the sense that it generates $\mathcal T(\mathcal S)$. 
- **Comparison using basis**: Let $\mathcal{B},\mathcal{B}'$ be basis for $\mathcal{T},\mathcal{T}'$, then $\mathcal{T}'$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}$ iff for each pair $x\in B\in\mathcal B$ there is a basis element $B'\in\mathcal{B}'$ such that $x\in B'\subseteq B$.
## Set-theoretic concepts
Many concepts defined on more subtle structures can be generalized to topological spaces. 
- **Neighborhood**: a neighborhood of $x\in X$ is a subset $N\subseteq X$ satisfying $$\exists V\in\mathcal T\quad\st\quad x\in N\subseteq V$$We usually denote a neighborhood of $x$ as $N_x$. 
- **Interior & closure**: we define the interior and closure operators as $$\inte A=\bigcup_{B\in\mathcal T_X,B\subseteq A}B,\quad\overline A=\bigcap_{(X\backslash B)\in\mathcal T_X,A\subseteq B}B$$by definition we have $\inte A\subseteq A\subseteq \overline A$.
	- **Point of closure (adherent point)**: $x\in X$ is an adherent point of $A$, denoted $x\in\overline A$, if any neighborhood of $x$ contains a point of $A$. 
	- **Boundary**: we define the boundary of $A$ as $$\partial A=\left.\overline A\ \right\backslash\inte A=\overline A\cap\overline{(X\backslash A)}$$A **boundary point** is any point belonging to the boundary. The $\partial A$ is sometimes called the **topological boundary** to distinguish it from the manifold boundary defined in [[Topological Manifold]].
- **Limit point**: $x\in A$ is a limit point if $$(N_x\cap A)\backslash \set{x}\neq\varnothing,\quad\forall N_x\ni x$$Set of limit point is called the **derived set** $A'$. We have $\overline A=A\cup A'$. 
	- **Difference with adherent point**: the key distinction is that, for a limit point its neighborhood is required to intersect with $A$ at points **other than $x$ itself**, while for an adherent point isolated points are also included. Therefore a limit point must be an adherent point but not vise versa. 
- **Dense subset**: $A\subseteq X$ is dense if any one of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:
  - The smallest closed subset of $X$ containing $A$ is $X$ itself.
  - The closure of $A$ in $X$ is equal to $X$.
	- **Nowhere dense subset**: $A\subseteq X$ is nowhere dense if the interior of its closure is empty. This is also equivalent to being not dense in any open set. 
	- **Relation with "not dense at every point"**: be cautious that nowhere dense set may still be "dense at a point", in the sense that it has a limit. The key problem is that, any non-empty set is always "dense" at points it contains, hence density would not make sense.
- **Separability**: $(X,\mathcal T)$ is separable if it contains a countable ([[Set]]) dense subset. 
	- Note that this has nothing to do with [[Separation Axioms]] except that they're both named after the intuition of separating things. 
## Compactness
A space $X$ is **compact** if each open covering has a finite sub-covering.
- **Compactness of subspace**: subspace $Y$ is compact iff every covering of $Y$ by sets open in $X$ has a finite sub-covering that covers $Y$, due to direct inheritance of open sets.
	- Every closed subspace $Y$ of compact space $X$ is compact. This can be shown by adding $X-Y$ into the covering.
	- **Every compact subspace $Y$ of Hausdorff space $X$ is closed**: we only need to show that $X-Y$ is open, which is obvious using Hausdorff condition and compactness.
- **Image under continuous map**: image of compact subspace $Y$ under a continuous function is compact.
	- Let $f:X\to Y$ be continuous bijection. If $X$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff, then $f$ is homeomorphism.
	- Let $f:X\to Y$ where $Y$ is compact Hausdorff, then $f$ is continuous iff the graph of $f$ $$G_f=\set{x\times f(x):x\in X}$$is closed in $X\times Y$.
- **Closed set criterion**: a collection $\mathcal C$ of closed set is said to have **finite intersection property** if intersection of any finite sub-collection is non-empty. A topological space $X$ is compact iff for every collection $\mathcal C$ with finite intersection property, the intersection $\bigcap_{C\in\mathcal C}C$ is non-empty.
- For simply ordered set $X$ having the least upper bound property, in the order topology each closed interval is compact.
- **Tychonoff theorem**: product of any collection of compact spaces $X=\prod X_\alpha$ is compact w.r.t product topology.
  **Proof**: given any collection of closed sets $\mathcal A\in\mathcal P(X)$ denote $\mathfrak A$ the collection of subsets of $\mathcal P(X)$ that contains $\mathcal A$ and only closed subsets, and has finite intersection property, and let $\subseteq n$ be the strict partial order in $\mathfrak A$. It can be shown that conditions of Zorn's lemma ([[Order]]) are satisfied, thus there is a maximal element in $\mathfrak A$, which we'll denote as $\mathcal D$. Now for any $\alpha\in J$ consider $\set{\pi_\alpha(D):D\in\mathcal D}$. It has finite intersection property, and by compactness of $X_\alpha$ there exists $x_\alpha\in X_\alpha$ such that  $$x_\alpha\in\bigcap_{D\in\mathcal D}\overline{\pi_\alpha(D)}$$let $x=(x_\alpha)_{\alpha\in J}$, then it suffice to show $x\in\overline D,\forall D\in\mathcal D$. Given any subbasis element $\pi_\beta^{-1}(U_\beta)$ containing $x$, since $x_\beta\in\overline{\pi_\beta(D)}$, $U_\beta$ intersects with $\pi_\beta(D)$ in some $\pi_\beta(y)$ where $y\in D$, then $y\in\pi_\beta^{-1}(U_\beta)\cap D$. This means $\pi_\beta^{-1}(U_\beta)$ intersects with every element of $\mathcal D$, and by maximality we have $\pi_\beta^{-1}(U_\beta)\in\mathcal D$. Since $\mathcal D$ is also closed under finite intersection, this inclusion spreads to every basis element, hence $x\in D,\forall D\in\mathcal D$.
	- **Main idea**: there are three main ideas behind the above proof:
	  1. **Choose closed set criterion**: it's quite easy to prove the result on finite product using open cover definition, but this is hard to be generalized to arbitrary product. In contrast, definition via closed set provides more freedom.
	  2. **Force "good" choice by expansion**: it's easily seen that under some example $x_i\in X_i$ can be chosen "badly" s.t. $(x_1,\cdots)$ is not in $\prod X_i$. To avoid this bad choice we impose more constraint by adding new elements into the collection of closed sets.
	  3. **Extreme case**: following 2, one key idea is to directly pick the largest possible expansion, and check whether it makes the idea work.
- **Sequential compactness**: $(X,\mathcal T)$ is sequentially compact if every sequence of points in $X$ has a convergent subsequence converging to a point in $X$.
	- **Non-equivalence**: there exists compact topological spaces that are not sequentially compact, and sequentially compact topological spaces that are not compact.
## Countability axiom
- **First countability**: a space is said to have a **countable basis** at $x$ if there is a countable collection $\mathcal B$ of neighborhoods of $x$ s.t. each neighborhood contains at least one $B\in\mathcal B$. A space is **first-countable** if it has a countable basis at each point.
- **Second countability**: if a space has a countable basis for its topology, then it's said to be **second-countable**.
	- **Lindelöf space**: for second-countable $X$, every open covering has a countable sub-covering. Space with such property is called Lindelöf space, which is weaker than second countability
	- **Dense subset**: second-countable $X$ has a countable senes subset, by picking one point from each of the basis element.
In general, second-countability is way more stronger than first-countability, and even not all metric space satisfy it, say, $\mathbb R$ induced by discrete metric $d(x,y)=1-\delta_{xy}$.
- Both countability axioms are preserved under taking subspace and product space.
## Baire space
A topological space $(X,\mathcal T)$ is a **Baire space** if it satisfies any of the following conditions: 
1. Every countable union of closed nowhere dense sets has empty interior.
2. Every countable intersection of dense open sets is dense.
3. Every Baire first category set has empty interior
Here we classify subsets of $C$ into two different classes:
- **Meagre (Baire first category)**: $A\subseteq X$ is meagre if it's a countable union of nowhere dense set.
	- **Comeagre**: $A\subseteq X$ is comeagre if $X\backslash A$ is meagre.
- **Non-meagre (Baire second category)**: $B\subseteq X$ is non-meagre if it contains a countable intersection of open dense sets.
Note that a subset of $X$ is either a meagre or a non-meagre.
