Given a [[Metric Space]] $(X,d)$, the **metric topology** on $X$ is the topology generated by $$\mathcal B=\set{B_\varepsilon(x):x\in X,\varepsilon>0}$$, or we can add an extra condition $\varepsilon\le\delta$ for any $\delta>0$.
- **Uniform topology**: given index set $J$, define the **uniform metric** $\overline\rho$ on $\mathbb R^J$ by $$\overline\rho(x,y)=\sup\Set{\overline d(x_\alpha,y_\alpha):\alpha\in J}\quad\text{where}\quad\overline d(x,y)=\min\set{|x-y|,1}$$then the topology induced by $\overline\rho$ is called the **uniform topology**.
	- **Basis of uniform topology**: according to definition the basis is of the form $$\mathcal B=\Set{\bigcup_{\delta<\varepsilon}\prod_{\alpha\in J}B_\delta(x_\alpha):\varepsilon>0,x_\alpha\in X}$$We can't use $\prod_{\alpha\in J}B_\varepsilon(x_\alpha)$ because it contains elements whose coordinate approaches $\varepsilon$ at $\infty$ and takes exactly $\varepsilon$ under $\sup$.
	- For infinite $J$ we have $$\text{product topology}\subset\text{uniform topology}\subset\text{box topology}$$**Proof**: we can also proof the inclusion easily by comparing their basis element, and then observe that uniform topology allows infinite coordinates to not equal $\mathbb R$, but also requires all interval to be of "uniform size", say, $\prod(-1/n,1/n)$ contains no ball under uniform metric.
- **Metric that induces $\mathbb R^\omega$**: let $D(x,y)=\sup\set{\overline d(x_i,y_i)/i}$, then $D$ induces the product topology $\mathbb R^\omega$. This can be shown by comparison of basis.
- **Continuity of distance with a subset**: given $E\subset X$, define the function $$f_E:X\to\mathbb R,\quad f_E(x)=d(x,E)$$This is a useful tool that is used in the construction of many auxiliary functions. 
	- **Lipschitz continuity**: we have that $$|f_E(x)-f_E(y)|\le d(x,y)$$**Proof**: by the triangle inequality ([[Metric Space]]) we have $$d(x,p)\le d(x,y)+d(y,p),\quad\forall p\in E$$by definition of distance as a infimum we have $$d(x,E)\le d(x,y)+d(y,p),\quad\forall p\in E$$now since $p$ is arbitrary we can further conclude that $$d(x,E)\le d(x,y)+d(y,E)\quad\iff\quad d(x,E)-d(y,E)\le d(x,y)$$Exchanging $x,y$ yields the other half of the desired inequality. 
	- **Equidistant set**: in many practical applications we're interested in the equidistant set of subsets $A,B\subset X$ defined by $$E(A,B)=\set{x\in X:d(x,A)=d(x,B)}$$One related, fascinating topic in geometry, biology, and computer science is the properties and generations of **Voronoi set**.
## Urysohn metrization theorem
A topological space $(X,\mathcal T)$ is **metrizable** if there exists a metric $d$ on $X$ that induces $\mathcal T$. As long as a metric is define, we can connect open set language of topology to $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ language of real analysis, giving rising to everything we're familiar from in [[Function on Euclidean Space]] and [[Series]].
We have the following theorem on metrizable space:
**Urysohn metrization theorem**: every regular space $X$ with a countable basis is metrizable.
**Proof**: the main idea is to imbed $X$ in a metric space $Y$. Below we provide two different $Y$'s that can be used to proof the result.
1. There exists countable collection of continuous $f_n:X\to[0,1]$ have the property that given $x_0\in X$ and neighborhood $U$ there exists an index $n$ s.t. $f_n$ is positive at $x_0$ and vanishes outside $U$. These functions can be constructed by apply the Urysohn lemma ([[Separation Axioms]]) to each pair $(B_m,B_n)\in\mathcal B\times\mathcal B$ satisfying $\overline{B_m}\subset B_n$.
2. Consider $Y=\mathbb R^\omega$ with product topology. Define $F:X\to\mathbb R^\omega$ by $F(x)=(f_1(x),f_2(x),\cdots)$, then $F$ is an imbedding, because:
	1. $F$ is continuous, since each $f_n$ is continuous, and we're using product topology.
	2. $F$ is injective, since when $x\neq y$ there exists disjoint neighborhood of each by regularity, thus there exists $n$ s.t. $f_n(x)>0,f_n(y)=0\Rightarrow F(x)\neq F(y)$.
	3. $F$ is homeomorphism onto $Z=F(X)$, since for each $z_0=f(x_0)\in f(U)$ where $U$ open in $X$, choose $N$ s.t. $f_N(x_0)>0$ and vanishes outside $U$, then $W=Z\cap\pi_N^{-1}((0,\infty))$ satisfies $z_0\in W\subset f(U)$.
3. Consider $Y=\mathbb R^\omega$ with uniform topology. Use the same construction $F$ with additional requirement that $f_n(x)\le1/n$ (say, by dividing $n$ for each $f_n$). $F$ is imbedding because:
	1. $F$ is injective by step 2
	2. $F^{-1}$ is continuous set since uniform topology is finer than product topology. [[Topological Space]]
	3. $F$ is continuous, since given $\varepsilon>0$ we can find $N$ large with $1/N\le\varepsilon/2$, for $1\le n\le N$ let $U_n$ be such that $x\in U_n\Rightarrow|f_n(x)-f_n(x_0)|\le\varepsilon/2$, and let $U=\bigcap_{n\le N}U_n$, then we have $x\in U\Rightarrow\rho(F(x),F(x_0))\le\varepsilon/2$.
- **Imbedding theorem**: for $X$ satisfying $T_1$ axiom, if $\set{f_\alpha}_{\alpha\in J}$ is a set of continuous $f_\alpha\to\mathbb R$ with the property that given any $x_0$ and its neighborhood $U$, there exists $\alpha$ s.t. $f_\alpha$ is positive at $x_0$ and vanishes outside $U$, then $F:X\to\mathbb R^J$ defined by $F(x)=(f_\alpha(x))_{\alpha\in J}$ is an imbedding. If $\im f_\alpha\subset[0,1]$, then $F$ imbeds $X$ in $[0,1]^J$.
	- This is a stronger result from step 2 of the above proof.
	- **Corollary**: a space $X$ is completely regular iff it's homeomorphic to a subspace of $[0,1]^J$ for some $J$.
## Local metrizability
A space $X$ is locally metrizable if each $x\in X$ has a neighborhood that is metrizable in the subspace topology.
- A compact Hausdorff space that is locally metrizable is metrizable.
