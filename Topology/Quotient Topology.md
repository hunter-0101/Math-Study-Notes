Let $(X, \mathcal T_X)$ be a [[Topological Space]] and $\sim$ an equivalence [[Relation]] on $X$. Let $Q = X / \sim$ be the quotient sett, and $\pi: X \to Q$ be the **canonical projection**. The **quotient topology** $\mathcal T_Q$ on $Q$ is the **final topology** ([[Continuous Function]]) w.r.t $\pi$. Explicitly, the topology is given by $$\mathcal T_Q = \Set{ U \subseteq Q : p^{-1}(U) \in \mathcal T_X }$$That is, $U \subseteq Q$ is **open** in $(Q, \mathcal T_Q)$ iff its preimage under the projection is open in $X$, and $K \subseteq Q$ is **closed** iff $p^{-1}(K)$ is closed in $X$.
- **Intuition**: historically, the quotient topology formalizes the geometric process of "gluing" or "identifying" points in the theory of [[Homotopy]]. If $x \sim y$, we treat them as the same point in the resulting space.
- **Non-preservation of properties**: the quotient topology is "notoriously ill-behaved." Properties like $T_2$ (Hausdorff), $T_1$, or first-countability are not necessarily inherited from $X$ to $Q$.
## Quotient Map
Given [[Topological Space]] $(X,\mathcal T_X),(Y,\mathcal T_Y)$, a surjective ([[Relation]]) map $f: (X, \mathcal T_X) \to (Y, \mathcal T_Y)$ is a **quotient map** if it satisfies $$V \in \mathcal T_Y\qiffq f^{-1}(V)\in\mathcal T_X$$Every quotient map $f$ induces an equivalence relation $\sim_f$ on $X$ defined by $$x \sim_f x' \qiffq f(x) = f(x')$$The space $Y$ is then canonically homeomorphic to the induced quotient space $X / \sim_f$.
