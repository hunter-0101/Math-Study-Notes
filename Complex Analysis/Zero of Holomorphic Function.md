For non-constant [[Holomorphic Function]] $f\in\mathcal O(N_c)$ with $f(c)=0$ we say that $c\in\mathbb Z$ is a **zero** of $f$, with the **order of zero** defined as $$\ord(f,c)=\min_{n\in\mathbb Z,a_n\neq0}n\where f(z)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}a_n(z-c)^n$$When $\ord(f,c)=1$ we say that $c$ is a **simple zero**. 
- **Identity principle**: given $f\in\mathcal O(D)$, if the collection of zeros of $f$ has a limit point within the domain $D$, then $f(z)=0,\forall z\in D$. 
  **Proof**: let $c_n\to c\in D$ be a sequence of zeros of $f$converging to another zero, then by results on Laurent series ([[Holomorphic Function]]) there exists $m\in\mathbb N$ s.t. $$f(z)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}a_n(z-c)^n=a_m(z-c)^m(1+g(z-c))\qtextq{with}\lim_{z\to c}g(z-c)=0$$If $f$ is not identically zero within any neighborhood $N_c$, we have $a_m\neq0$, and by substituting $z=c_n$ into the identity we have that $$g(c_n-c)=-1,\forall n\imply\lim_{z\to c}g(z-c)=-1$$which is a contradiction. Now consider the set  $$Z=\Set{z\in\mathbb C:f\equiv0\text{ on some neighborhood }N_z}$$Now $Z$ is open by its definition, closed by continuity of $f$, and non-empty since the argument above establishes $c\in Z$. We can conclude from connectedness of $D$ that $C=D$ ([[Connected Space]]). 
	- **Corollary**: a non-constant holomorphic function has finitely many zeros within a compact domain.
	- **Limit point on boundary**: it might happen that the collection of zeros of a holomorphic function has a limit point on the boundary of the domain, e.g., $\sin(1/z)$. In such case the limit point would actually become an essential singularity ([[Holomorphic Function]]) 
- **Sparsity of zeros**: for entire $f$ with growth order $\rho$ and zeros $\set{a_n}$ let $n(r)=|\set{a_n}\cap B_r|$. Then $n(r)\le C|r|^\rho$ for large enough $r$, and $\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}|a_n|^{-s}<\infty$ for all $s>\rho$.
  **Proof**: by variant of Jensen's formula ([[Contour Integral]]), we have that $$n(r)\ln2=n(r)\int_r^{2r}\frac{dx}{x}\le\int_0^{2r}\frac{n(x)dx}{x}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\ln|f(2re^{i\theta})|d\theta-\ln|f(0)|$$Thus $n(r)\le C_1 r^\rho+C_2$. The second part is an easy estimation $$\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}|z_n|^{-s}=\sum_{j\in\mathbb N}\left(\sum_{2^j\le|z_n|<2^{j+1}}|z_n|^{-s}\right)\le\sum_{j\in\mathbb N}2^{-js}n(2^{j+1})\le C\sum_{j\in\mathbb N}2^{-js}2^{(j+1)\rho}<\infty$$The last inequality is because $s>\rho$.
## Weierstrass factorization theorem
**Motivation**: it's already known that given a set of points $\set{z_n}$, a necessary condition for them to be the zeroes of some entire function is $\lim_{n\to\infty}|z_n|\to\infty$. Weierstrass factorization theorem answers the converse, i.e., the above condition is also sufficient for the existence of some entire function that takes the prescribed points as zeroes. At the same time, notice that if both entire $f_1,f_2$ satisfies the prescribed zeroes, then $f_1/f_2$ is entire, non-vanishing, with removable singularities at $\set{z_n}$, hence can be represented as $f_1/f_2=\exp g$ for some entire $g$. Now the only problem is to find one $f$ that vanishes at $\set{z_n}$ and nowhere else.
Define the **Weierstrass canonical factor** $E_k(z)$ of **degree** $k$ as $$E_0(z)=1-z,\quad E_k(z)=(1-z)e^{z+\frac{z^2}{2}+\cdots+\frac{z^k}{k}},k\in\mathbb N$$This will serve as the basis for our construction of entire function with given zeros. ![[Pasted image 20250228095656.png]]
- **Intuition**: the problem with $\prod(1-z/c_k)$ is that it only converges when $\sum 1/|c_n|<\infty$, which is not always the case. This is mainly because when $z\to1$ the linear term vanishes linearly. In contrast, since $$\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{\xi^i}{i}=\ln\paren{(1-\xi)^{-1}}\Rightarrow \exp\paren{\sum_{i=1}^\infty\frac{\xi^i}{i}}=(1-\xi)^{-1}$$Thus we also have $E_k(\xi)\to1,\xi\to0$, and estimation of vanishing rate shows that $$|E_k(\xi)-1|=\abs{(1-\xi)\exp\paren{\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{\xi^i}{i}}\paren{1-\exp\paren{\sum_{i=k+1}^\infty\frac{\xi^i}{i}}}}=O\paren{|\xi|^{k+1}},\quad\xi\to0$$which is also illustrated by the above figures (solid boundary indicates $f(z)=2^i,i\in\mathbb Z$).
- **Weierstrass theorem**: given $\set{c_n}_{n\in\mathbb N}\subset\mathbb C\setminus\set{0}$ without point of accumulation, and a positive sequence $\set{k_n}\subset\mathbb N$ such that $$\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\paren{\frac{r}{|c_n|}}^{k_n+1}<\infty,\quad\forall r\in\mathbb R_+$$then there is an entire function $f$ whose zero set, with multiplicity counted, is $\set{c_n}$, given by $$f(z)=\prod_{n\in\mathbb N}E_{k_n}\paren{\frac{z}{c_n}}$$**Proof**: fix $r>0$ and assume $|z|\le r$. Then we know that $$\abs{1-E_{k_n}\paren{\frac{z}{c_n}}}\le\abs{\frac{z}{c_n}}^{k_n+1}\le\paren{\frac{r}{|c_n|}}^{k_n+1}$$thus by property of product series ([[Complex Sequence]]) $f(z)$ converges uniformly on all compact subset of $\mathbb C$ to an entire function.
	- **Convergence condition**: in the condition we require the inequality to hold for arbitrary $r>0$ to ensure that the product converges on entire $\mathbb C$. This can actually weakened to $\sum(1/|c_n|)^{k_n+1}<\infty$, with a bit more reasoning on the arbitrariness of compact sub-domain. 
	- **Choice for $\set{k_n}$**: as long as $\set{k_n}$ is chosen such that the condition on $\set{c_n}$ is satisfied, the convergence would hold. Thus given a $\set{c_n}$ there is usually many $\set{k_n}$ available. In practice we usually pick $k_n=n$ and use geometric sequence to bound the error.
- **Weierstrass factorization theorem**: for entire $f$ with $v_0(f)=k$, let $\set{c_n}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be set of zeros excluding $0$, listed with multiplicities, then there exists entire $g$ and $\set{k_n}\subset\mathbb N$ with $$f(z)=z^ke^{g(z)}\prod_{n\in\mathbb N}E_{k_n}\left(\frac{z}{c_n}\right),\quad\forall z\in\mathbb C$$**Proof**: just choose the $P(z)=\prod E_{k_n}$ terms by Weierstrass theorem and let $G(z)=\frac{f(z)}{z^kP(z)}$. Since $G(z)$ is entire and non-vanishing, there exist $g$ with $e^{g(z)}=G(z)$.
	- The theorem may be generalized to any $D\subsetneq\overline{\mathbb C}$.
	- **Entire non-vanishing functions**: for $f:\Omega\to\mathbb C$ analytic on simply connected $\Omega$ that is entire and non-vanishing, pick $a\in\Omega$ and let $$g(z)=\ln f(a)+\int_{\xi=a}^z\frac{f'(\xi)d\xi}{f(\xi)}$$then $g'(z)=f'(z)/f(z)$, thus $(f(z)e^{-g(z)})'=0$, which means that $f=e^g$.
	- **Choice of $\set{k_n}$**: we can choose $k_n=k$ being the largest integer less than $\rho$ the growth order of $f$.
- **Hadamard factorization theorem**: for entire $f$ of finite order $\rho$, by the sparsity of its zeros, for optimal $k=\lfloor\rho\rfloor$ we have the Hadamard factorization $$f(z)=z^me^{g(z)}\prod_{n\in\mathbb N}E_k\left(\frac{z}{a_n}\right)$$This form follows directly from the above results, and a rigorous proof for $\deg g\le k$ need the following two estimations.
	- **Lower bounds on $\prod E_k$**: pick $\rho<s<k+1$. We separate the product into two parts for estimation: those large $n$ with $|z/a_n|<\frac{1}{2}$, and the rest. 
	  1. $|z/a_n|<\frac{1}{2}$: since $(1-z)^{-1}=\exp(\sum z^j/j)$, we have $$|E_k(z/a_n)|=\left|\exp\left(-\sum_{j\ge k+1}\frac{(z/a_n)^j}{j}\right)\right|\ge \exp(-2|z/a_n|^{k+1})= \exp(-2|z/a_n|^{k+1-s}|z|^s/|a_n|^s)$$then $|E_k(z/a_n)|\ge\exp(-(1/2)^{k-s}|z|^s/|a_n|^s)$, thus we have $$\left|\prod_{n\text{ large}}E_k(z/a_n)\right|\ge \exp(-C|z|^s)$$where $C=2^{s-k}\sum_{n=1}^\infty|a_n|^{-s}$.
	  2. $|z/a_n|\ge\frac{1}{2}$: the exponential terms has a bound of the same order via direct estimation. For the $(1-z/a_n)$ terms, to ensure similar boundedness, we only consider $$z\notin\bigcup_{n\text{ small}}B_n\quad\text{where}\quad B_n=\set{|z-a_n|<|a_n|^{-k-1}}$$Given this condition we have that $$\begin{align}\prod_{n\text{ small}}\left|1-\frac{z}{a_n}\right|&=\prod_{n\text{ small}}\left|\frac{a_n-z}{a_n}\right|\ge\prod_{n\text{ small}}|a_n|^{-k-2}\\&=\exp\left(-(k+2)\sum_{\text{n small}}\ln|a_n|\right)\ge\exp(-(k+2)n(2|z|)\ln2|z|)\\&\ge\exp(C|z|^s\ln2|z|)\ge\exp(C'|z|^{s'})\end{align}$$Where the inequality in the second row used the sparsity of zeroes. Since $s>\rho$ can be taken arbitrarily close to $\rho$, we could replace $s'$ with $s$. Note that $\sum|a_n|^{-k-1}<\infty$, hence we can find a sequence of radii $r_n\to\infty$ s.t. $\set{C_{r_n}}$ do not intersects with the aforementioned disks $\bigcup B_n$.
	- **Upper bound on $g(z)$**: above lower bound shows that $$e^{\Re g(z)}=|e^{g(z)}|\le A\exp(B|z|^\rho+C|z|^s)\le\exp(C|z|^s),\quad |z|=r\text{ stated above}$$which means $\Re g(re^{i\theta})\le Cr^s$, thus by [[Cauchy Integral]] $g(z)$ is a polynomial whose degree is at most $\lfloor s\rfloor=k$.
- **Applications**
	- **Number of roots**: $e^z-z$ has infinitely many roots, since otherwise by $\rho(e^z-z)=1$ we'll have $e^z-z=e^{\alpha z}\prod_{k=1}^nE_1(z/a_k)$, which can be simplified into $e^z-z=e^{\gamma z}P(z)$ for some polynomial $P$. Now differentiate both sides twice to get $e^z=R(z)$ for some polynomial $R(z)$, which is a contradiction.
	- **Number of zeros for entire function of non-integer order**: if $\rho_f\notin\mathbb Z$ then in Hadamard factorization the $\exp^g$ will also have non-integer order, which is a contradiction.
	- **Meromorphic functions with prescribed zeroes and poles**: since any meromorphic function $h$ is a quotient of two entire functions $g/h$, with zeroes of $g$ being zeroes of $f$ while zeroes of $h$ being poles of $f$, we can replace $g,h$ with their Hadamard factorization, and add a $\exp p$ term if necessary.
## Zero expansion
We list some useful zero expansions of entire functions. $$\begin{align}&\sin z=z\prod_{n=1}^\infty\paren{1-\frac{z^2}{n^2\pi^2}})&\sinh z=z\prod_{n=1}^\infty\paren{1+\frac{z^2}{n^2\pi^2}}\\&\cos z=\prod_{n=1}^\infty\paren{1-\frac{4z^2}{(2n-1)^2\pi^2}}&\cosh z=\prod_{n=1}^\infty\paren{1+\frac{4z^2}{(2n-1)^2\pi^2}}\end{align}$$
