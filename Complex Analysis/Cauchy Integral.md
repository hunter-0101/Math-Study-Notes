Given $f\in C(\gamma)$ on smooth Jordan curve $\gamma$, we define its **Cauchy integral** $F$ as $$C(f)(z)=F(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(\xi)d\xi}{\xi-z}$$We have $F(z)\in\mathcal O(\mathbb C\backslash\gamma)$ by Morera theorem, and we have $F^+(\xi_0)-F^-(\xi_0)=f(\xi_0)$ where $\xi_0\in\gamma$, $F^+,F^-$ corresponding to inside/outside of $\gamma$. We can prove this by the decomposition $$F(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{(f(\xi)-f(\xi_0))d\xi}{\xi-z}+\frac{f(\xi_0)}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{d\xi}{\xi-z}$$Notice that first term equals under $z\to\xi_0^+$ and $z\to\xi_0^-$, while the second integral is $I(\gamma,z)$.
- **Cauchy integral as a projection**: let $S\subset L^2([-\pi,\pi])$ consists of all functions $f$ s.t. $\hat f(n)=0,\forall n<0$, then by the proof of Fatou's theorem ([[Complex Sequence]]) $S$ can be identified with the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb D)$, hence is a closed subspace unitarily isomorphic to $\ell^2(\mathbb N)$. With a bit calculation we can show that $P_S(f)=C(f)$. More detail can be found in [[Hardy Space]].
- **Cauchy–Goursat theorem**: for $U\subset\mathbb C$ simply connected open and $f\in\mathcal O(U)$, let $\gamma:[a,b]\to U$ be a smooth closed curve, then$$\oint_\gamma f(z)dz=0\quad\text{if}\quad\gamma\sim0$$Note that this is a direct result of the above theorem, considering the fact that any holomorphic function has a primitive.
	- **Proof 1**: we break the elements into $f=u+iv,dz=dx+idy$, then $$\oint_\gamma f(z)dz=\oint_\gamma(udx-vdy)+i\oint_\gamma(vdx+udy)$$Now apply Green's theorem (or Stokes' theorem in [[Integral Calculus on Smooth Manifold]]), by the Cauchy-Riemann equation both terms equals $0$, yielding the result. Note that this proof requires the assumption that $f'$ is continuous.
	- **Proof 2**: the original proof due to Goursat reasons as follows:
	  1. **Repetitive separation**: a domain can be separated into sub-domains, with integral on extra contours canceling each other out. Now by taking absolute value we have $|\int_\gamma f(z)dz|\le4\sup|\int_{\gamma'}f(z)dz|$. Repeat this process, and notice that contraction of area is one order faster than length.
	  2. **Limit of integral approaches zero**: in the limit case, the area is sufficiently small, and $f(z)$ can be replaced by it Taylor expansion. By directly evaluating the integral of Taylor expansion we show that the limit approaches $0$.
	- **Explicit calculation**: using Stock's theorem ([[Integral Calculus on Smooth Manifold]]) we have in general $$\int_{\partial D} f(z)dz=2i\int_D\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline z}(z+iy)dxdy$$
## Cauchy's integral formula
**Cauchy's integral formula**: for $U\subset\mathbb C$ an open set and a disk $D=\set{z:|z-z_0|\le r}\subset U$, denote $C=\partial D$, then for any holomorphic $f:U\to\mathbb C$ we have $$f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_C\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-z}d\xi$$**Proof**: by considering the key-lock shape contour, Cauchy-Goursat theorem yields that the contour integral along $C$ equals the integral along any circle surrounding $z\in D$. Denote $C_\varepsilon$ the circle centered at $z$ with radius $\varepsilon$, then $$\begin{align}\left | \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{C_\varepsilon} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-z}d\xi  - f(z) \right |&= \left | \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{C_\varepsilon} \frac{f(\xi)-f(z)}{\xi-z} d\xi \right |\\&= \left | \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_0^{2\pi}\left(\frac{f(\xi(t))-f(z)}{\varepsilon e^{it}}\cdot\varepsilon e^{it} i\right )d\xi\right |\\&\leq\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{|f(\xi(t)) - f(z)| } {\varepsilon}\varepsilon dt \\&\leq \max_{|\xi-z|=\varepsilon}|f(\xi)-f(z)|\quad\xrightarrow{\varepsilon\to 0}\quad0\end{align}$$Obviously $C$ can be replaced by any Jordan curve, since $\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-z}$ is holomorphic on $U\backslash\set{z}$.
- **Discussion**: in the above expression $f(\xi)$ are the **weight** we already know (boundary values), and $\frac{1}{\xi-z}$ is the **analytic kernel** that encodes exactly "how much" boundary point contributes to the value at $z$. Formally we have $$\overline\partial_z\left(\frac{1}{\pi(z-\lambda)}\right)=\delta_\lambda\quad\iff\quad\left\langle\overline\partial_z\left(\frac{1}{\pi(z-\lambda)}\right),\varphi\right\rangle=\left\langle\frac{1}{\pi(z-\lambda)},\overline\partial_z\varphi\right\rangle=\varphi(\lambda)$$By Green-Stokes with the vector field $u(z)/(z-\lambda),u\in C^1$ we get $$u(\lambda)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_\Omega\frac{\overline\partial_z u(z)}{z-\lambda}dA(z)+\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial\Omega}\frac{u(z)}{z-\lambda}dz,\quad\lambda\in\Omega$$Hence as long as $u\in\mathcal O(\Omega)$ the first term vanishes, and the evaluation is purely a boundary phenomenon, otherwise the kernel $\frac{1}{z-\lambda}$ act as a right inverse up to boundary correction. This difference in role turned out to be explicit in [[Holomorphic Functional Calculus]].
- **Poisson integral formula**: given $f\in\mathcal O(\mathbb D),z\in\mathbb D$ we have $$\begin{align}2\pi if(z)&=\int_C\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-z}d\xi-\int_C\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-1/\overline z}d\xi\\&=\int_C\frac{z-1/\overline z}{\xi^2-(z+1/\overline z)\xi+z/\overline z}f(\xi)d\xi\\&=\int_C\frac{z\overline z-1}{\xi\overline z+\xi^{-1}z-(|z|^2+1)}f(\xi)\frac{d\xi}{\xi}\\&=\int_C\frac{1-|z|^2}{1-2\Re(z\overline\xi)+|z|^2}f(\xi)\frac{d\xi}{\xi}\\&=\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\cos(\theta-t)+r^2}f(e^{it})idt\end{align}$$where $\theta=\arg z$, hence we have $$f(re^{i\theta})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1-r^2}{1-2r\cos(\theta-t)+r^2}f(e^{i\theta})dt=\frac{1}{2\pi}P_r(\theta)*f(e^{i\theta})$$we call $P_r(\theta)$ the Poisson kernel. [[Convolution]]
- **Gauss' mean value theorem**: by directly evaluation we get $$f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}f(z+re^{i\phi})d\phi$$which holds for any $C_r=\set{\xi:|\xi-z|=r}$.
- **Cauchy's differentiation formula**: we can directly verify by definition that $$f^{(n)}(z)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{f(\xi)}{(\xi-z)^{n+1}}d\xi$$This can be intuitively explained using Laurent series. [[Complex Function]]
	- **Cauchy's inequality**: by direct evaluation we get that for holomorphic $f$ on an open set that contains the closure of $D$ centered at $z$ and radius $R$ we have$$|f^{(n)}(z)|\le\frac{n!\|f\|_C}{R^n}$$where $\|f\|_C=\sup_{z\in C}|f(z)|$.
		- **Cauchy's inequality on real part**: see [[Holomorphic Function#Real/Imaginary part]].
- **Liouville's theorem**: if $f$ is entire and bounded, then $f$ is constant (actually we only need the boundedness on a sequence of circles $C_R$ with $R\to\infty$).
  **Proof**: by Cauchy inequality we have $|f'(z_0)|\le B/R$ where $B$ is the bound. Let $R\to\infty$, we get $f'(z_0)=0,\forall z_0\in\mathbb C$, hence $f$ must be constant.
	- **Proof via Schwarz lemma**: Schwarz lemma ([[Geometry of Holomorphic Function]]) applied on $|z|=R$ as $R\to\infty$ compresses $f$ into one constant point.
	- **Proof via maximum modulus principle**: for $f\in\mathcal O(\mathbb C)$ bounded, consider $g(z)=f(1/z)$, then $g:\mathbb C\backslash\set{0}\to\mathbb C$ is bounded holomorphic, hence extends to another bounded entire function by Riemann's analytic continuation theorem ([[Holomorphic Function]]). This means $f$ extends to an entire function $f\in\mathcal O(\mathbb P)$ over the [[Riemann Sphere]]. Now by compactness of $\mathbb P$ we know that $f$ has a global maximum, which contradicts the maximum modulus principle. 
	- **Corollary**: any non-constant polynomial has a root in $\mathbb C$ (otherwise $1/P(z)$ would be bounded and entire), and by repeating this corollary we get the **fundamental theorem of algebra**.
	- **Generalization**: if $f$ is entire with $|f(z)|\le A|z|^k+B$ for all $z\in\mathbb C$ (or on a list of arbitrarily large circles) then $\deg f\le k$. The proof is essentially the same, utilizing the Cauchy's inequality for $n>k$.
	- **Liouville's theorem on real part**: entire $f$ with bounded real part is constant by Liouville's theorem on $\exp f$; for $f=u+vi$ with $u(re^{i\theta})\le Cr^s$ for a sequence $r\to\infty$ and $s\ge 0$, $f$ must be a polynomial with $\deg f\le s$.
	  **Proof**: by Cauchy's inequality for real part ([[Holomorphic Function]]) we have $$|f^{(n)}(0)|\le n!(2Cr^{s-n}-2u(0)r^{-n})$$Let $r\to\infty$ then the upper bound approaches $0$ for $n>s$, thus $f(z)=\sum\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}z^n$ is a polynomial with $\deg f\le s$.
		- **Proof via harmonic analysis**: bounded harmonic function is constant, hence holomorphic function with bounded real part is constant; the rest cases follows in similar ways. [[Harmonic function]]
		- **Proof via Cauchy's inequality**: apply Cauchy's inequality on real part ([[Holomorphic Function]]) to get the result.
		- **Corollary**: for entire $f$ with finite order $\rho$, then $f=\exp(p(z))$ for some $\deg p\le\rho$.
- **Application in analytic continuation**: say $f:\mathbb C\backslash(K_1\cup K_2)\to\mathbb C$ is holomorphic, then we may decompose it into $f=f_1+f_2$ with $f_i:\mathbb C\backslash(K_i)\to\mathbb C$ holomorphic in the following manner: $$f_1(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\left(\int_{C_r}\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-z}d\xi-\int_{K_{1r}}\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-z}d\xi\right),\quad f_2=f-f_1$$$f_1$ is holomorphic on $C_r\backslash K_{1r}$, and since it's independent of $r$, it must be holomorphic on $\mathbb C\backslash K_1$. By Cauchy theorem $f_2$ is exactly the integral along the contour $K_{2r}$, thus is holomorphic on $\mathbb C\backslash K_2$. The key here is to **remove singularity by inclusion/exclusion of domains**, i.e., $C_r\sim K_{1r}+K_{2r}+C_z$.
