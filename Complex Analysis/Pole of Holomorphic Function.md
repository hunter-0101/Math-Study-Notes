For non-constant [[Holomorphic Function]] $f\in\mathcal O\paren{N_p\setminus\set{p}}$ s.t. $\lim_{z\to p}f(z)=\infty$ (in the sense of [[Riemann Sphere]]), we say that $p\in\mathbb Z$ is a **pole** of $f$, with **order of pole** defined as $$\ord(f,p)=\min_{n\in\mathbb Z,a_n\neq0}n\where f(z)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}a_n(z-c)^n$$When $\ord(f,p)=-1$ we say that $p$ is a **simple pole** of $f$. 
- **Characterization of pole via Laurent series**: $p\in\mathbb C$ is a pole iff the principal part of Laurent expansion of $f$ at $p$ contains only finitely many non-zero terms.
  **Proof**: $(\Leftarrow)$ is trivial. For $(\Rightarrow)$, notice that $$\lim_{z\to p}\frac{1}{f(z)}=0$$Hence $1/f(z)\in\mathcal O(N_p)$ by analytic continuation theorem ([[Holomorphic Function]]), therefore has a finite order of zero by [[Zero of Holomorphic Function]], that is, $$\frac{1}{f(z)}=z^Ng(z)\where g(z)\neq0,\forall z\in N_p$$Taking the reciprocal of both sides yields the result. 
	- **Corollary**: if $\ord(f,p)=n,n<0$, then 
- **Limit point of poles**: if $c$ is a limit point of poles of $f$, then $f(N_c)$ is dense in $\overline{\mathbb C}$. This is proven similarly as Casorati-Weierstrass theorem. [[Holomorphic Function]]
- **Runge's theorem**: for compact $K\subset\mathbb C$ and $S\subset\overline{\mathbb C}\backslash K$ that intersects non-trivially each connected component of $\overline{\mathbb C}\backslash K$, if $f$ is holomorphic on open $\Omega\supset K$, then it can be uniformly approximated on $K$ by rational functions with simple poles inside $S$.
  **Proof**: by Cauchy's integral formula we have $$f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\sum_{i=1}^n\int_{\gamma_i}\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi-z}d\xi,\quad\forall z\in K$$where $\gamma_i\subset\Omega\backslash K$ surrounds each connected component of $K$. We can use the Riemann sum to approximate each integral uniformly, and since each term in the Riemann sum is of the form $\frac{1}{\alpha-z}$, it can be approximated uniformly using geometric series expansion, just like what we did in Laurent series.

## Mittag-Leffler theorem
Let $\set{p_k}$ be a discrete set of points in $\Omega\subset\mathbb C$, and for each $k$ let $Q_k(z)$ be a polynomial without a constant term. There exists a meromorphic $f$ with poles at $p_k$ and holomorphic everywhere else, and all such function $f$ are of the form $$f(z)=\sum_k\left(Q_k\left(\frac{1}{z-p_k}\right)-q_k(z)\right)+H(z)$$where $q_k(z),H(z)$ are holomorphic on $\Omega$, and $q_k(z)$ only depends on $Q_k(z)$. Moreover, if $\set{p_k}$ is finite then we can take $q_k\equiv0$; if $\Omega=\mathbb C$ and $|p_k|\to\infty$ then we can take each $q_k$ as polynomials.
**Proof**: when $\set{p_k}$ is finite the result is obvious; when $\Omega=\mathbb C$ we can take $Q_k(1/(z-p_k))$ as the principal part of the Laurent series, and $q_k(z)$ as the first $d_k$ terms of the Taylor series of $Q_k$ at $0$, with some lower bounds of $d_k$ and estimation of modulus to ensure convergence. For general $\Omega\subsetneq\mathbb C$ we can take $q_k(z)$ based on Runge's theorem to ensure convergence.
- Mittag-Leffler theorem is sister to the Weierstrass factorization theorem ([[Zero of Holomorphic Function]]), 
- **Theorem for simple poles**: if meromorphic $f$ on $\mathbb C$ only have simple poles at $\set{p_k}$, satisfying  $|f(z)|<M$ on each $C_N$ where $r(C_N)\to\infty$, then we can write $$f(z)=f(0)+\sum_k\res(f,p_k)\left(\frac{1}{z-p_k}+\frac{1}p_k{}\right)$$This can be seen as a corollary, or can also be proved directly using basic techniques from [[Contour Integral]] by considering $\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_N}\frac{f(z)}{z-\xi},\xi\in\mathbb C$.
## Pole expansion
We list some useful pole expansions of meromorphic functions. $$\begin{align}&\frac{1}{\sin z}=\frac{1}{z}-\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{2z}{z^2-n^2\pi^2}&\frac{1}{\sinh z}=\frac{1}{z}-\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{2z}{z^2+n^2\pi^2}\\&\frac{1}{\cos z}=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\frac{(2n+1)\pi}{((2n+1)\pi/2)^2-z^2}&\frac{1}{\cosh}=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\frac{(2n+1)\pi}{((2n+1)\pi/2)^2+z^2}\\&\tan z=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\frac{2z}{((2n+1)\pi/2)^2-z^2}&\tanh z=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\frac{2z}{((2n+1)\pi/2)^2+z^2}\\&\cot z=\frac{1}{z}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{2z}{z^2-n^2\pi^2}&\coth z=\frac{1}{z}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{2z}{z^2+n^2\pi^2}\end{align}$$
