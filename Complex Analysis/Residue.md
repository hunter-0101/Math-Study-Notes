Given a meromorphic function $f$ ([[Holomorphic Function]]), the **residue** of $f$ at a pole $p\in\mathbb C$ ([[Pole of Holomorphic Function]]) is defined as $$\res(f,p)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma f(z)dz$$where $\gamma$ is a Jordan curve surrounding $p$ that is small enough, so that $f$ is holomorphic on the interior of $\gamma$ except for $p$. 
- **Discussion**: residue is an intrinsic property of the meromorphic [[Differential Form]] $fdz$, since being an integral, it is **invariant under coordinate transform**. This follows from the change of variable formula ([[Integral Calculus on Smooth Manifold]]), since given $z=z(w)$ an smooth invertible coordinate transform we have $$\int_{\gamma_z} f(z)dz=\int_{\gamma_w}f(z(w))\frac{dz}{dw}dw$$Intuitively, it measures the **failure of the form to be exact** in a punctured neighborhood. 
- **Cohomology interpretation**: once a pole $p\in D$ is introduced, the fundamental group ([[Homotopy]]) on $D\setminus \set{p}$ becomes $\mathbb Z$, and the residue is precisely the scalar the identifies the class of $\omega$ in the first de Rham cohomology group: $$H_{dR}^1(D\setminus\set{p},\mathbb C)\cong\mathbb C$$More can be found in [[De Rham Cohomology]]. 
## Calculation of residue
By results in [[Contour Integral]], we can represent the residue of $f$ at $p$ explicitly using coefficients of Laurent series ([[Holomorphic Function]]) as $$\res(f,p)=a_{-1}\where f(z)=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}a_n(z-p)^n$$When $p$ is a simple pole this is further equivalent to $$\res(f,p)=R\quad\st\quad f(z)-\frac{R}{z-p}\text{ has analytic primitive}$$This is useful when the Laurent series is easy to calculate.
- **Residue at pole of finite order**: given $p$ a pole of order $n\in\mathbb N$ by Laurent series we have $$\res(f,p)=a_{-1}=\frac{1}{(n-1)!}\lim_{z\to p}\frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}}[(z-p)^nf(z)]$$Specifically, for $n=1$ the formula degenerates to $$\res(f,c)=\frac{\phi(p)}{\psi'(p)}\where f=\phi/\psi$$This formula helps to greatly reduces the computational complexity. 
## Residue theorem
**Residue theorem**: for $f\in\mathcal O(D)\setminus\set{p_k}_{1\le k\le n}$ where $p_k$ are all its poles within $D$, we have $$\int_\gamma f(z)dz=2\pi i\sum_{k=1}^n\res(f,p_k)\where\gamma=\partial D$$**Proof**: by Cauchy-Goursat theorem ([[Cauchy Integral]]) we have $$\int_\gamma f(z)dz=\sum_{k=1}^n\int_{\partial B(p_k,\delta_k)}f(z)dz$$where $\delta_k>0$ is small enough so that $B(p_k,\delta_k)\subseteq D$ and $f$ is holomorphic on $B(p_k,\delta_k)\setminus\set{p_k}$. Now the theorem follows directly from the definition of residue. 
- **Total residue formula**: given $f$ meromorphic with finitely many poles $p_k,1\le k\le n$, define its residue at infinity, by change of variable $z\mapsto 1/z$, as$$\res(f,\infty)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma_R^-}f(z)dz$$where $\gamma_R^-=\set{z:|z|=R}$ is a counterclockwise-oriented circle that is large enough to surround all the poles of $f$, then applying the residue theorem we get $$\sum_{k=1}^n\res(f,c_k)+\res(f,\infty)=0$$While trivial, it could be useful in some cases.
	- **Calculation**: by the representation under change of variable mentioned above, we have $$\res(f,\infty)=\res\left(-\frac{1}{z^2}f\left(\frac{1}{z}\right),0\right)$$This is well-defined because $f(\infty)=0$ for a meromorphic function with finitely many poles. 
	- **Discussion**: while straightforward from definition, we can actually deduce the total residue formula from a more holistic perspective. Summing residues at all poles is equivalent to integrating along the union of Jordan curves surrounding each pole, and since [[Riemann Sphere]] is compact, we necessarily have $$\sum_{p\in\mathbb P}\res(\omega,p)=0,\quad\forall\omega\in M^1(\mathbb P)$$This reasoning actually applies to any compact Riemann surface, and we'll get the same result when its (topological) boundary is empty.
