Given $f$ holomorphic on $\Omega$, if there exists holomorphic $F$ that agrees with $f$ within $\Omega$ and is also defined outside of $\Omega$, then $F$ is called the **analytic continuation** of $f$.
- **Multivalued function**: given two domains $P\cap Q=\varnothing$ and a holomorphic $f$ defined on $P$, although the analytic continuation along any path $PR_1\cdots R_n Q$ is unique, the results of different paths on $Q$ need not agree, in which case we have a multivalued function. [[Complex Function]]
- **Schwarz's reflection principle**: given $f$ holomorphic on $\Omega_+$ above $\mathbb R$ while being real on $\mathbb R$, consider $f^*(z)=\overline{f(\overline z)}$, then $f^*$ agree with $f$ on $\mathbb R$, hence serve as an analytic continuation of $f$ to the other half of the plane.
	- **Complex inversion**: reflection is not limited to line reflection. We can also consider $f^*(z)=1/\overline{f(1/\overline z)}$ when given $f$ on $\mathbb D$.
- **Continuation with dominated Fourier transform**: if $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb C$ satisfies $|\hat f(\xi)|\le Ae^{-2\pi a|\xi|}$ for some constant $A,a$, then $f$ can be analytically continued to a function holomorphic in the strip $S_b=\set{z\in\mathbb C:|\Im z|<b}$ for any $0<b<a$.
  **Proof**: let $f_n(z)=\int_{-n}^n\hat f(\xi)e^{2\pi i\xi z}d\xi$, then $f_n$ is entire ([[Holomorphic Function]]). Note that if we let $f(z)=\int_\mathbb R\hat f(\xi)e^{2\pi i\xi z}d\xi$ then the integral converges absolutely for $z\in S_b$, and for all $z\in S_b$ $$|f(z)-f_n(z)|\le A\int_{|\xi|\ge n}e^{-2\pi a|\xi|}e^{2\pi b|\xi|}d\xi\to0,\quad n\to\infty$$hence the convergence is uniform, meaning that $f$ is also holomorphic.
- A lot of discussion can be found in [[Hardy Space]].
## Paley-Wiener theorem
There are several versions of Paley-Wiener theorem stating existence of analytic continuation given some conditions on the boundary function. 
**Theorem**: assuming $f\in C(\mathbb R)$ with $f,\hat f\in L^1$, then $f$ is the restriction to $\mathbb R$ of an entire with $|f(z)|\le Ae^{2\pi M|z|}$ for some $A>0$ iff $\supp\hat f\subset[-M,M]$.
**Proof**: $\Leftarrow$ is immediate since by [[FT on L1]] with $f,\hat f\in L^1$ we can define $$f(z)=\int_{-M}^M\hat f(\xi)e^{2\pi i\xi z}d\xi\quad\Longrightarrow\quad|f(z)|\le Ae^{2\pi M|z|}$$which is entire as an integral ([[Complex Function]]). Conversely we first assume $$|f(x+iy)|\le A'\frac{e^{2\pi M|y|}}{1+x^2},\quad\forall x,y\in\mathbb R$$then by rectangle [[Contour Integral]] we have that $$|\hat f(\xi)|=\left|\int_\mathbb Rf(x)e^{-2\pi i\xi x}dx\right|=\left|\int_\mathbb R f(x-iy)e^{-2\pi i\xi(x-iy)}dx\right|\le A'\int_\mathbb R\frac{e^{2\pi My-2\pi\xi y}}{1+x^2}dx\le Ce^{-2\pi y(\xi-M)}$$Let $y\to\infty$, then we get $\hat f(\xi)=0,\forall\xi>M$, and together with a symmetric argument we have $\hat f(\xi)=0,\forall|\xi|>M$. Weakening the assumption to $|f(x+iy)|\le e^{2\pi M|y|}$ we can consider $$\begin{align}f_{1,\epsilon}(z)&=\frac{f(z)}{(1+i\epsilon z)^2}\to f(z),\quad\epsilon\searrow0,\forall\Im z\le0\\ f_{2,\epsilon}(z)&=\frac{f(z)}{(1-i\epsilon z)^2}\to f(z),\quad\epsilon\searrow0,\forall\Im z\ge0\end{align}$$then the above argument can be applied, with $\hat f_{k,\epsilon}\to\hat f,k=1,2$ ensured by [[FT on L1]]. Finally it suffices to show that the growth condition $$|f(z)|\le Ae^{2\pi M|z|}\quad\overset{?}{\Longrightarrow}\quad|f(x+iy)|\le A'e^{2\pi M|y|}$$Consider $F(z)=f(z)e^{2\pi iMz},x,y>0$, then we can verified that conditions for the lemma below are satisfied (with rotation), hence we immediately get $|f(z)|\le e^{2\pi My}$ on this sector. Similar arguments for other quadrants completes the proof.
- **Phragmén-Lindelöf theorem**: for $F\in C(\overline S)\cap\mathcal O(S)$ on sector $S=\set{z:-\pi/4<\arg z<\pi/4}$, assume that $|F(z)|\le1,\forall z\in\partial S$, and $|F(z)|\le Ce^{c|z|}$, then we actually have $|F(z)|\le1,\forall z\in\overline S$.
  **Proof**: consider the suppressed version $$F_\epsilon(z)=F(z)e^{-\epsilon z^{3/2}}\to0,\quad z\to\infty,\forall\epsilon>0$$Hence $\sup|F_\epsilon|$ is reached at finite $z$, hence maximum modulus principle ([[Complex Geometry]]) yields $\sup|F_\epsilon|\le1$. Let $\epsilon\to0$, then the bound is carried to $F$.
## Interpolation
- **Interpolating converging sequence**: for $\set{z_k}\subset D$ an open set in $\overline{\mathbb C}$ accumulating at the boundary $\partial D$ and $\set{a_k}\subset\mathbb C$, then there is an holomorphic function $f$ on $D$ such that $f(z_k)=a_k$ for all $k$.
  **Proof**: we basically mimics the Newton interpolation in [[Polynomial Interpolation]], but add some modulus-controlling terms to ensure convergence. First we apply the Möbius transform if necessary to ensure that $\infty\in D$, i.e., $\partial D$ is compact. Choose a sequence $\set{y_k}\subset\partial D$ s.t. $|z_k-y_k|\to0$. Now we consider the function of the form $$f(z)=\sum_{k\in\mathbb N}c_k(z-z_1)\cdots(z-z_{k-1})\frac{(z_k-y_k)^{n_k}}{(z-y_k)^{n_k}}$$by reasoning in Newton polynomial, there is only one choice of $c_k$ once $c_0,\cdots,c_{k-1}$ are fixed. Further, if we choose $n_k$ large enough along the way, then $$c_k(z-z_1)\cdots(z-z_{k-1})\frac{(z_k-y_k)^{n_k}}{(z-y_k)^{n_k}}\to0,\quad\forall z\in\set{z:|z-y_k|\ge2|z_k-y_k|}$$the convergence is uniform, thus we can choose $n_k$ such that each term is bounded by $2^{-k}$. Now it's obvious that $f(z)$ is indeed a holomorphic function.
- **Pringsheim interpolation formula**: given $\set{a_n}$ with $\lim|a_n|=\infty,a_0=0$ and its associated Weierstrass product $E(z)$, for any $\set{b_n}$ there exists integers $m_n\ge1$ s.t. $$F(z)=\frac{b_0}{E'(z)}\frac{E(z)}{z}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{b_n}{E'(a_n)}\frac{E(z)}{z-a_n}\left(\frac{z}{a_n}\right)^{m_n}$$defines an entire function satisfying $F(a_n)=b_n,\forall n$.
