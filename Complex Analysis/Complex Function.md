Complex functions inherit all definitions and properties from [[Function on Euclidean Space]] in real analysis, including continuity, convergence, etc. We'll mainly focus on [[Holomorphic Function]], and further **entire** (holomorphic on entire $\mathbb{C}$) and **meromorphic** (has no singularities in $\mathbb C$ except poles) ones.
- **Why $\mathbb C$ is so different from $\mathbb R^2$**: the main difference lies in their **algebraic structure**. 
	- $\mathbb R^2$ is simply a [[Vector Space]], and the most refined structure we have is linearity. For $f:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^2$ two coordinates are treated separately, and it's very common that $f$ has no directional derivative except for those along $x$ or $y$. 
	- $\mathbb C$ is a [[Field]], and for $f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$ complex multiplication introduces both scaling and rotation counter-clockwise, which forces $f$ to behaves locally like multiplication by some $z\in\mathbb C$. The key is that we're considering $\mathbb C$-linearity rather than $\mathbb R$-linearity. 
  Another less motivating but interesting way of viewing complex analysis is that we're investigating a set of functions in $C^1(\mathbb R^2)$ that satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equation, and the second requirement allows us to use tools from $\mathbb C$, which "happen" to tailored for this purpose. 
- **Comparison between different fields**: let's go over three different fields:
	- **[[Real Number System]] $\mathbb R$**:  the only structure we have is linearity compatible with additivity and multiplication, and as can be seen in [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]], even differentiable at every point cannot guarantee the continuity of derivative. 
	- **Complex number $\mathbb C$**: this is a bit stronger, since geometrically there are two linearly independent axis related by complex multiplication. This imposes stronger regulation on the manifold structure of the field itself, and as discussed below, complex differentiability is immediately equivalent to smoothness and analyticity. 
	- **Quaternion $\mathbb H$**: as defined in [[Ring Gallery]], for quaternions three linearly independent axis are closely related to each other via multiplication, and as it turns out, the only quaternion-differentiable function is $f(q)=aq+b,a,b\in\mathbb H$.
	- **Split-complex numbers**: algebraically we define $$\mathbb D=\set{x+yj:x,y\in\mathbb R,j^2=1,j\neq\pm1}$$which forms an algebra over the [[Field]] $\mathbb R$. Behaviors of differentiable functions on $\mathbb D$ is more weird, and Liouville's theorems fails since there exists non-constant entire $\mathbb D$b-differentiable functions that are bounded.

**Remark**: in the folder of complex analysis a **domain** will refer to a non-empty, connected, open subset of $\mathbb C$.

## Fundamental theorem of complex function theory
Let $f=u+iv:D\to\mathbb C$ be a complex-valued function, then **all the following definitions or conditions are equivalent to holomorphicity**, which is defined in [[Holomorphic Function]]
- **Cauchy-Riemann equations**: $f$ is complex differentiable iff $f(x,y)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)$ with $u,v$ real differentiable ([[Function on Euclidean Space]]) satisfies $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=i\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\iff\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y},\quad\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=-\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\iff(\nabla u)\cdot(\nabla v)=0$$This is based on the requirement that complex derivative defined using the limit $$f'(z)=\lim_{\Delta z\to0}\frac{f(z+\Delta z)-f(z)}{\Delta z}$$must be well-defined, i.e., has the same value along any path converging to $0$. To put in another way, it's saying that the Jacobian of $(u,v)$ is of the form $\begin{pmatrix}a&-b\\b&a\end{pmatrix}$, which is a pure scaling and rotation.
	- **Polar form**: by change of variable or direct calculation, the polar form is $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial\theta}=ir\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\iff\frac{\partial R}{\partial\theta}=-rR\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial r},\quad R\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial\theta}=r\frac{\partial R}{\partial r}$$with similar geometric interpretations.
- **Wirtinger derivative**: based on C-R equation we define two linear operators $$\frac{\partial}{\partial z}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-i\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right),\quad\frac{\partial}{\partial\overline z}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+i\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)$$The for $f=u+iv$ we'll have the equivalence $$f\text{ satisfies C-R equations}\quad\iff\quad\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=i\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\quad\iff\quad f'(z)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\quad\iff\quad\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline z}=0$$Note that definitions of the operators $\frac{\partial}{\partial z},\frac{\partial}{\partial\overline z}$ are **purely formal**, although they can be associated with the conventional intuition of coefficient of linear approximation. 
	- **Linear approximation of general complex function**: it's easily verifiable that $$\mathcal L_\mathbb R(\mathbb C)=\set{l=az+b\overline z:a,b\in\mathbb C}\quad\mathcal L_\mathbb C(\mathbb C)=\set{l=az:a\in\mathbb C}$$hence for a general complex function its linear approximation can be written as $$f(z)-f(c)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}(z-c)+\frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline{z}}\overline{(z-c)}+o(|z-c|)$$Hence wirtinger derivative basically generalize differentiability from $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb C$. 
	- **Relation with Laplacian**: notice that $$4\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\frac{\partial}{\partial\overline z}=4\frac{\partial}{\partial\overline z}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}=\Delta$$Hence holomorphic function has harmonic real/imaginary parts. [[Holomorphic Function]]
	- **Relation between different derivatives**: given $f=u+iv$ holomorphic we have $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}=i\frac{\partial v}{\partial z},\quad\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}+i\frac{\partial v}{\partial z}=2\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}=2i\frac{\partial v}{\partial z}$$Intuitively the change caused by $\Delta z$ should agree between $u,v$ so that the overall effect is balanced into one linear term. They're useful when real/imaginary parts need to be considered separately.
	- **Comparison with $C^1(\mathbb R^2,\mathbb R^2)$**: while both the Wirtinger derivative and differentiability in $\mathbb R^2$ implies a linear approximation, complex differentiability is much stronger since it requires different directional derivatives to have the **same magnitude**. 
	- **Directional derivative**: notice that $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial z_\theta}=\lim_{|\Delta z|\to0,\arg\Delta z=\theta}\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta z}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline z}e^{-2i\theta}$$thus to make it invariant along all directions we must have $\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline z}=0$.
	- For homomorphic function the Jacobian satisfies $$\det J_f(x_0,y_0)=\left|\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\right|^2-\left|\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline z}\right|^2=|f'(z_0)|^2$$Also note that by CR equations we have $f'(c)=f_x(c)=-if_y(c)$.
- **Primitive**: for a simply connected $D$ there exists a holomorphic $F:D\to\mathbb C$ such that $$F'(z)=f(z),\quad\forall z\in D$$**Proof**: after defining [[Contour Integral]] we can directly verify the Cauchy-Goursat theorem and [[Cauchy Integral]]. Utilizing the Cauchy integral representation we can express $F$ as a Contour integral, and directly show that such integral is infinitely differentiable. This, by first equivalent condition above, shows that $f$ is holomorphic.
	- **Intuition**: we basically relies on properties of [[Cauchy Integral]] to prove the lemma. It's worth noting that this formula is not a post-hoc finding, but a deterministic character of holomorphicity that is not illustrated by previous definitions. It says that holomorphic function is so "rigid" and "regular" that even just fixing values on a curve could determine the function entirely. Related theorem is the identity principle ([[Zero of Holomorphic Function]]).
- **Morera's theorem**: if for any closed piece-wise smooth $\gamma\subset D$, we have $$\int_\gamma f(z)dz=0$$where the integral is defined in [[Contour Integral]], then $f$ is holomorphic. The converse in given by the Cauchy-Goursat theorem ([[Cauchy Integral]]).
  **Proof**: define the integration as $F(z)=\int_\gamma f(z)dz$ for any $\gamma$ that starts at fixed $z_0$ and ends with $z$, then $F(z)$ is differentiable at any point with $F'=f$, hence is holomorphic, and $f$ being its derivative, is also holomorphic.
	- **Intuition**: the integral condition seems global, but its crux lies in the universality of closed curve $\gamma$. The key is that the contour integral will remain vanishing even we shrink the loop to infinitesimally small, which can only happen when the function is differentiable at every point. To sum up, enforcing a global property across all scales forces a local structure. This is particularly similar to the fact that $\int_Efd\mu=0,\forall E\in\mathcal L$ implies $f=0\ae$. [[Lebesgue Integral]]
	- **Weaker assumption**: given any fixed contour $\Gamma$, if for all its translates and dilates the integral vanishes, then $f$ is holomorphic.
	  **Proof**: mimicking approximation to the identity ([[Convolution]]), for suitable smooth $\varphi(z)=\varphi(x,y)$ satisfying $\varphi(x,y)\in[0,1],\int_{\mathbb R^2}\varphi(x,y)dxdy=1$, consider the series of kernels $\varphi_\varepsilon(z)=\varepsilon^{-2}\varphi(\varepsilon^{-1}z)$ and let $$f_\varepsilon(z)=\int_{\mathbb R^2}f(z-w)\varphi_\varepsilon(w)dw$$then each $f_\varepsilon$ is smooth with vanishing contour integral on a contour small enough, hence by Wirtinger derivative it's holomorphic. Since $f_\varepsilon\to f$ uniformly on compact subset we know that $f$ is also holomorphic. 
- **Analyticity**: $f$ can be expressed as **Taylor series expansion** given in [[Holomorphic Function]]. This is also equivalent to the fact that $f^{(n)}(z)$ exists for all $n\in\mathbb N$.
  **Proof**: for $(\Rightarrow)$ apply [[Cauchy Integral]] to $\partial D$ and write $$\frac{1}{\xi-z}=\frac{1}{\xi-z_0-(z-z_0)}=\frac{1}{\xi-z_0}\frac{1}{1-\left(\frac{z-z_0}{\xi-z_0}\right)}$$Now by geometric expansion we can derive the result ([[Holomorphic Function#Laurent series]]); $(\Leftarrow)$ follows from the term-wise differentiation property in [[Complex Sequence]].
	- **Intuition**: as mentioned above, complex differentiability is significantly more brutal than its real counterpart ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]), forcing holomorphic function to behave like a power series (locally at least). This behavior is also uniformly controlled (by Cauchy's integral formula), hence $\mathcal O$ turns out to be covered by all (converging) power series.
There are some other useful criterions for the holomorphicity of functions based on the above results, such as: 
- **Uniform limit**: given $f_n\to f$ which is uniform on any compact subset for holomorphic $f_n$, we have $f$ also holomorphic by Morera's theorem.
	- **Corollary**: in the above setting we have $f_n'\to f'$ also uniformly. It suffices to show $|F'|\to0$ uniformly given $F\to0$ uniformly, which is direct by [[Cauchy Integral]].
- **Integral**: consider $F(z,s)$ defined for $(z,s)\in\Omega\times[0,1]$ where $\Omega$ is open in $\mathbb C$. If $F(z,s)$ is holomorphic in $z$ for each $s$, and is continuous on $\Omega\times[0,1]$, then $f(z)=\int_0^1 F(z,s)ds$ defined by holomorphic.
  **Proof**: obviously each Riemann sum, as finite sum of holomorphic functions, is holomorphic. Since $F(z,s)$ is uniformly continuous in $s$ independent of $z$ ([[Function on Euclidean Space]]), convergence of Riemann sum is uniform, hence by the above lemma we have $f$ holomorphic. 
	- **Alternative proof**: we can directly apply Morera's theorem, given that interchangeability of integration is justified, which is actually obvious. [[Lebesgue Integral]]
## Differentiation rule
Since analytic function is conformal, i.e., acts like an amplitwist $dz\mapsto z_0dz$ locally, the ordinary rules of differentiation ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) continue to hold.
- **Linearity**: $\frac{d}{dz}(\alpha f+\beta g)=\alpha\frac{d}{dz}f+\beta\frac{d}{dz}g$.
- **Multiplication**: $(fg)'=f'g+fg'$.
- **Quotient rule**: $(f/g)'=[f\cdot(1/g)]'=(f'g-g'f)/g^2$.
- **Composition**: $\frac{d}{dz}(g\circ f)(z)=\frac{dg}{df}\frac{df}{dz}$.
- **Inverse function**: $\omega=f(z)$, then $(f^{-1})'(\omega)=1/f'(z)$. 
Their proofs are essentially the same as in real case. 
## Elementary function
- **Fractional linear function**: we define fractional linear functions as $f$ of the form$$f(z)=\frac{az+b}{cz+d},\quad ad-bc\neq0,f(0)=\infty,f(\infty)=\frac{a}{c}$$Then it can be verified that $f:\overline{\mathbb C}\to\overline{\mathbb C}$ is entire and conformal everywhere. We also call this kind of transform a **Möbius transform**. 
	- $f(z)=\frac{1}{z}$ maps all circles onto circles. Further, any fractional linear function $L$ maps points $z,z^*$ that are conjugate w.r.t a circle $\Gamma$ to $\omega,\omega^*$ that are conjugate w.r.t $L(\Gamma)$.
	- Set of FL forms a group w.r.t composition.
	- **Determination of FL**: given any two $3$-tuples of points $z_k,\omega_k\in\overline{\mathbb C}$, there exists a unique FL $L$ such that $L(z_k)=\omega_k,k=1,2,3$.
	  **Proof**: for existence we only need $(0,1,\infty)$ as a bridge. Uniqueness follows from the fact that FL forms a group.
- **Exponential function**: see [[Exponential Function]].
	- **Other exponentials**: for any $k\in\mathbb C$ the "branch" of $k^z=e^{l_nz}$ where $l_n=\Log k+2n\pi i$. 
	- **Complex trigonometric functions**: we define the cos and sin functions as $$\cos z=\frac{e^{iz}+e^{-iz}}{2},\quad\sin z=\frac{e^{iz}-e^{-iz}}{2i}$$The the Euler formula follows: $e^{iz}=\cos z+i\sin z$. Their reciprocal is denoted as $$\csc z=\frac{1}{\sin z},\quad\sec z=\frac{1}{\cos z}$$
		- **Hyperbolic functions**: notice that $$\cosh z=\cos iz,\quad\sinh z=-i\sin iz$$with $\sinh z,\cosh z$ inheriting the usual definition.![[Pasted image 20250302100335.png]]
	- **Properties**
		- $e^z$ is entire, and $\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(e^z)=e^z$. Thus it's an extension of the $e^x$ function.
		- The usual product rule $e^{z_1+z_2}=e^{z_1}+e^{z_2}$ still holds.
		- $e^z$ has a least period $\omega$. We define $\pi=2\omega$. Now we have established the result that $e^z=1$ iff $z=2\pi in,n\in\mathbb Z$.
		- If we define $$P_0(z)=-1,\quad P_n(z)=\frac{z^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}-\frac{z^n}{n!},\quad n\in\mathbb N$$then $-2P_0-P_1+P_3+2P_4+3P_5+\cdots=e^z=p_1+2P_2+3P_3+\cdots$. 
- **Logarithm function**: under the polar coordinate perspective, we define the multivalued logarithm function and its principal branch as  $$\ln z=\ln|z|+i\arg z,\quad\operatorname{Ln}z=\ln|z|+i\operatorname{Arg}z$$now it's a well-defined holomorphic function, satisfying all desired properties (inverse of exponential). Note that below we'll write $\ln,\arg$ in stead of $\operatorname{Ln},\operatorname{Arg}$ for convenience. ![[Pasted image 20250302104426.png]]
	- We have $$\ln z_1z_2=\ln z_1+\ln z_2+\delta$$ where$$\delta=\begin{cases}2\pi i&\text{if }-2\pi\le\arg z_1+\arg z_2\le-\pi\\0&\text{if }-\pi\le\arg z_1+\arg z_2\le\pi\\-2\pi i&\text{if }\pi\le\arg z_1+\arg z_2\le2\pi\end{cases}$$
	- If $f(z),g(z)$ are two branches of logarithm, then $f(z)-g(z)=2\pi in,n\in\mathbb Z$.
- **Complex exponential**: we define $z^c=e^{c\ln z}$ for $c\in\mathbb C,z\in\mathbb C_{\neq0}$.
## Multifunction
The following is the Riemann surface of $w=f(z)=\sqrt z$, using $[X,Y,Z,C]=[\Re z,\Im z,\Re w,\Im w]$ and $[X,Y,Z,C]=[\Re z,\Im z,\Im w,\Re w]$ respectively.![[Pasted image 20250304122615.png]]
- **Branch point**: for a multifunction $f(z)$, a branch point $z = q$ of $f$ is a point such that $f(z)$ fails to return to a as $z$ travels along any loop that encircles $q$ once.
	- **Order**: if $f(z)$ first returns to its original value after $N$ revolutions round $q$, then $q$ is called an algebraic branch point of order $(N - 1)$. A branch point of order $1$ is called a **simple branch point**, and a branch point of infinite order is called a **logarithmic branch point**.
	- **Convergence of Taylor series**: branch point also poses an obstacle to the convergence of Taylor series, since all polynomials are single-valued. Thus similar to poles, the Taylor series has disk of convergence expanding to the nearest branch point.
	- **Branch point at $\infty$**: one way to define branch point at $\infty$ is to perform inversion $z\mapsto1/z$ and check whether the new function has a branch point at $0$. Another definition is to consider a circle large enough.
- **Branch cut**: choose a initial value $f(z_1)$ and a path connecting $z_1,z_2$, and let $z$ go along the path. Notice that we can deform $\gamma$ continuously without crossing the branch point to obtain the same $f(z_2)$. Thus we can use some lines to partition $\mathbb C$ into a simply connected set $S$, on which each $f_i$ is single-valued. These lines are called **branch cut**, and $S$ is called one **branch**.
	- **Choice of branch cut**: the standard choice is a set of lines connecting each branch point together. Say, for $\frac{1}{\sqrt{(z+1)(z-1)}}$ we could choose the line segment $[-1,1]$.
