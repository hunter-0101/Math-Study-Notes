A **complex number** is an expression formally given by $$z=a+bi\where a,b\in\mathbb R$$as a [[Vector Space]] isomorphic to $\mathbb R^2$ ([[Real Number System]]). By specifying $$i^2=1\imply (a+bi)(c+di)=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i$$It's turned into a [[Field]]. 
- **Why $\mathbb C$ is so different from $\mathbb R^2$**: the main difference lies in their **algebraic structure**. 
	- $\mathbb R^2$ is simply a [[Vector Space]], and the most refined structure we have is linearity. For $f:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^2$ two coordinates are treated separately, and it's very common that $f$ has no directional derivative except for those along $x$ or $y$. 
	- $\mathbb C$ is a [[Field]], and for $f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$ complex multiplication introduces both scaling and rotation counter-clockwise, which forces $f$ to behaves locally like multiplication by some $z\in\mathbb C$. The key is that we're considering $\mathbb C$-linearity rather than $\mathbb R$-linearity. 
  Another less motivating but interesting way of viewing complex analysis is that we're investigating a set of functions in $C^1(\mathbb R^2)$ that satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equation, and the second requirement allows us to use tools from $\mathbb C$, which "happen" to tailored for this purpose. 
## Concepts & properties
- **Modulus**: we define the modulus of a complex number as $$|z|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$
- **Polar form**: the polar form of a complex number is given by $$z=r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)$$By induction we can prove the **de Moivre's theorem**: $$z^n=r^n(\cos n\theta+i\sin n\theta)$$This is quite useful in many cases. 
	- **Expansion of $\cos n\theta,\sin n\theta$**: applying the binomial theorem ([[Combination & Permutation]]) to the expression of $z^n$ we can get two identities $$\begin{align}\cos n\theta&=\sum_{\begin{matrix}0\le k\le n\\2\mid k\end{matrix}}\binom{n}{k}(\cos\theta)^{n-k}(i\sin\theta)^k\\\sin n\theta&=\frac{1}{i}\sum_{\begin{matrix}0\le k\le n\\2\not\mid k\end{matrix}}\binom{n}{k}(\cos\theta)^{n-k}(i\sin\theta)^k\end{align}$$These two expressions allows us to decompose $\cos n\theta,\sin n\theta$ into their building blocks. 
- **Euler's identity**: we have $$e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta+i\sin\theta,\quad\forall\theta$$**Proof**: we provide a proof based on the complex-analysis definition of $e$ ([[Complex Function]]). By the Laurent series of $e^x$ we have $$e^{i\theta}=\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}\frac{(i\theta)^n}{n!}=\sum_{2\mid n}\frac{(i\theta)^n}{n!}+\sum_{2\not\mid n}\frac{(i\theta)^n}{n!}=\cos\theta+i\sin\theta$$where we've used the related results on Laurent series ([[Holomorphic Function]]) of $\cos z,\sin z$.
