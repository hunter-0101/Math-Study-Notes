A **minimal surface** is a regular surface $S \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ which locally represents a stationary point for the area functional, often visualized physically as the shape assumed by a soap film spanned by a fixed boundary curve Plateau's Problem.
## Definition & fundamental facts
A smooth surface $S \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is a minimal surface if its mean curvature $H$ vanishes identically at every point $p \in S$: $$H(p) = \frac{1}{2}(\kappa_1 + \kappa_2) = 0 \quad \iff \quad \kappa_1 + \kappa_2 = 0$$where $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are the **principal curvatures** of the surface at $p$ [[Curvature of Surface]]. 1111
- Gaussian Curvature ($K$) is Non-positive: The vanishing of the mean curvature implies $\kappa_1 = -\kappa_2$. The Gaussian curvature $K$ is thus given by: $$K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2 = \kappa_1(-\kappa_1) = -\kappa_1^2 \le 0$$This means every point on a minimal surface (unless it is a planar point) is a **hyperbolic point**2.
- **Saddle Points**: Every point on a non-planar minimal surface is a **saddle point**, where the surface is equally curved in the two principal directions but in opposite normal directions3.
- **Area Minimality**: A minimal surface locally minimizes the surface area among all surfaces with the same boundary ([[Variational Principle]]).
- **Total Curvature**: The integral of the Gaussian curvature over the surface, $TC(S) = \int_{S} K dA$, is nonpositive, $TC(S) \in [-\infty, 0]$. $TC(S) = 0$ if and only if $S$ is a piece of a plane6.
## Equivalent Definitions and Deductions
There are three primary equivalent definitions for a surface $S \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ to be a minimal surface.
####  Minimal Surface $\iff$ Stationary Point of the Area Functional
A surface $S$ is a minimal surface if it is a stationary point of the area functional for local variations.
1. **Start with the Area Functional for a Graph**: for a graph surface over a domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ by $$S = G_f = \{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3: z=f(x,y)\}$$It area can be calculated as $$Area(f) = \int_{D}\sqrt{1+f_{x}^{2}+f_{y}^{2}}dxdy = \int_{D}\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^{2}}dxdy$$
2. **Variational Principle (Euler-Lagrange Equation)**: a surface is a stationary point of $Area(f)$ if the first variation with respect to a test function $h$ (vanishing on $\partial D$) is zero: $$\frac{d}{ds}|_{s=0}Area(f+sh)=0$$Applying the techniques of the Calculus of Variations, this leads to the Minimal Graph Equation (also known as the Euler-Lagrange equation for the area functional).
3. **The Minimal Graph Equation ($\mathcal{E}(f)=0$)**: $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{f_{x}}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^{2}}}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{f_{y}}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^{2}}}\right)=0$$Equivalently, expanding the derivatives, we get a quasilinear PDE: $$\mathcal{E}(f):=(1+f_{y}^{2})f_{xx}-2f_{x}f_{y}f_{xy}+(1+f_{x}^{2})f_{yy}=0$$
#### Minimal Graph Equation $\iff$ Vanishing Mean Curvature
The Minimal Graph Equation is precisely the condition for the surface to have zero mean curvature.
1. **Curvature of a Graph at a Critical Point**: if $p \in S$ is a critical point of $f$ ($\nabla f = \mathbf{0}$), a rigid change of coordinates aligns $T_pS$ with the $xy$-plane131313. The mean curvature $H$ is then simply the trace of the Hessian matrix $A$ of $f$: $$H = \kappa_1 + \kappa_2 = \text{trace} A = f_{xx}(0,0)+f_{yy}(0,0) = \Delta f(0,0)$$In this case, $\mathcal{E}(f) = (1+0)f_{xx}-0+(1+0)f_{yy} = \Delta f$. Thus $\mathcal{E}(f)=0 \iff H=0$.
2. **General Point**: for a general point $p$ (where $\nabla f \ne \mathbf{0}$), a coordinate transformation $(x,y,z) \mapsto (u,v,w)$ is used, where $T_pS$ aligns with the $uv$-plane ($w=g(u,v)$, $dg(0,0)=0$). The value of the minimal graph equation at $p$ is shown to be proportional to the Laplacian of the new height function, $\Delta g$: $$\mathcal{E}(f) = (1+f_{y}^{2})f_{xx}-2f_{x}f_{y}f_{xy}+(1+f_{x}^{2})f_{yy} = \sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^2}^3 \cdot \Delta g$$Since $\Delta g$ is the mean curvature $H$ of $S$ at $p$ in the new coordinates18, we conclude: $$\mathcal{E}(f)=0 \iff \Delta g = H = 0$$
#### C. Minimal Surface $\iff$ Conformal and Harmonic Immersion
The most physically and complex-analytically important characterization relates to parameterization.
1. **Conformal Parameterization**: an immersion $F: D \to \mathbb{R}^3$ with local coordinates $(u, v)$ is conformal (preserves angles) if the coefficients of the first fundamental form ([[Surface]]) satisfy: $$\braket{F_u, F_u} = \braket{F_v, F_v} \quad \text{and} \quad \braket{F_u, F_v} = 0$$The use of a conformal parameterization is the most natural for a minimal surface from the physical viewpoint21.
2. **The Equivalence (Geometric $\iff$ Harmonic)**: a conformal immersion $F=(x,y,z): D \to \mathbb{R}^3$ parameterizes a minimal surface ($H=0$) if and only if $F$ is a harmonic map, i.e., its components satisfy the Laplace equation in the domain coordinates: $$\Delta F = (\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z) = \mathbf{0}$$where $\Delta = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial u^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial v^2}$ is the Euclidean Laplacian on $\mathbb{R}^2$23.
3. **Deduction (Sketch)**: it is shown that for a conformal immersion $F$, the Laplacian of the position vector is proportional to the mean curvature vector field $\mathbf{H} = H \mathbf{N}$: $$\Delta F = \frac{1}{2}|\nabla F|^2 \mathbf{H}$$Since $|\nabla F|^2 = 2|F_u|^2 > 0$ for a regular surface, $\Delta F = \mathbf{0} \iff \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{0} \iff H=0$.
