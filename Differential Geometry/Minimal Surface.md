A **minimal surface** is a regular [[Surface]] $S \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ that locally minimizes its area, and is often visualized physically as the shape assumed by a soap film spanned by a fixed boundary curve. 
- **Plateau's problem**: this problem asks to show the existence of a minimal surface with a given boundary. This is considered part of the calculus of variation ([[Variational Principle]]), and the existence and regularity problems are part of geometric measure theory. 
## Definition
There are several equivalent definitions of minimal surfaces, each approaching this problems from different angles using different set of tools. Below we go over some of them.
1. **Minimal surface equation**: consider a graph surface over a domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ given by $$S = \Gamma(f) = \{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3: z=f(x,y)\}$$It area can be calculated as $$\mathrm{Area}(f) = \int_{D}\sqrt{1+f_{x}^{2}+f_{y}^{2}}dxdy = \int_{D}\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^{2}}dxdy$$By [[Variational Principle]], its critical point is equivalent to $$\left.\frac{d}{ds}\right|_{s=0}\mathrm{Area}(f+sh)=0,\quad\forall h\in C^2(D)$$By simplifying the expression above we get the $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{f_{x}}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^{2}}}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{f_{y}}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^{2}}}\right)=0$$Equivalently, expanding the derivatives, we get a quasilinear PDE ([[Linear PDE]]) $$\mathcal E(f)=(1+f_{y}^{2})f_{xx}-2f_{x}f_{y}f_{xy}+(1+f_{x}^{2})f_{yy}=0$$which is usually called the **minimal surface equation**.
2. **Vanishing mean curvature**: smooth $S \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is a minimal surface iff $$H(p) = \frac{1}{2}(\kappa_1 + \kappa_2) = 0\quad\forall p\in S$$where $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are the **principal curvatures** ([[Surface]]).
   **Proof of equivalence**: if $p=(x_p,y_p,f(x_p,y_p))$ is a critical point, i.e., $\nabla f(x_p,y_p)=0$ at $p$, then $T_pS$ is parallel to the $xOy$ plane, hence $\mathbf n=(0,0,1)$, in which case we have $$\one=\begin{pmatrix}1+f_x^2&f_xf_y\\f_xf_y&1+f_y^2\end{pmatrix},\quad\two=\begin{pmatrix}f_{xx}&f_{xy}\\f_{xy}&f_{yy}\end{pmatrix}$$therefore the mean curvature is given by $$H=\frac{1}{2}\frac{(1+f_x^2)f_{yy}-2f_xf_yf_{xy}+(1+f_y^2)f_{xx}}{(1+f_x^2)(1+f_y^2)-f_x^2f_y^2}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\mathcal E(f)}{(1+f_x^2)(1+f_y^2)-f_x^2f_y^2}$$therefore we have the equivalence $$H=0\quad\iff\quad\mathcal E(f)=0$$For a general point $p$, notice that $\one$ is unchanged, while $\two$ varies by a constant multiplier (since the first two coordinates $x,y$ vanishes under second order derivative), therefore the equivalence follows trivially.
3. Conformal and Harmonic Immersion: **Conformal Parameterization**: an immersion $F: D \to \mathbb{R}^3$ with local coordinates $(u, v)$ is conformal (preserves angles) if the coefficients of the first fundamental form ([[Surface]]) satisfy: $$\braket{F_u, F_u} = \braket{F_v, F_v} \quad \text{and} \quad \braket{F_u, F_v} = 0$$The use of a conformal parameterization is the most natural for a minimal surface from the physical viewpoint21.
	1. **The Equivalence (Geometric $\iff$ Harmonic)**: a conformal immersion $F=(x,y,z): D \to \mathbb{R}^3$ parameterizes a minimal surface ($H=0$) if and only if $F$ is a harmonic map, i.e., its components satisfy the Laplace equation in the domain coordinates: $$\Delta F = (\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z) = \mathbf{0}$$where $\Delta = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial u^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial v^2}$ is the Euclidean Laplacian on $\mathbb{R}^2$23.
	2. **Deduction (Sketch)**: it is shown that for a conformal immersion $F$, the Laplacian of the position vector is proportional to the mean curvature vector field $\mathbf{H} = H \mathbf{N}$: $$\Delta F = \frac{1}{2}|\nabla F|^2 \mathbf{H}$$Since $|\nabla F|^2 = 2|F_u|^2 > 0$ for a regular surface, $\Delta F = \mathbf{0} \iff \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{0} \iff H=0$.
