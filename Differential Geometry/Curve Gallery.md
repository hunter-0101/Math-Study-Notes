## Bézier curve
- **Recursive definition**: a Bézier curve of degree $n$ is a point-to-point linear interpolation of a pair of corresponding points in two Bézier curves of degree $n-1$. Let $B_{P_0P_1\cdots P_n}$ denotes the Bézier curve determined by $P_0,\cdots,P_n$, then we have $$B_{P_0}=P_0,\quad B_{P_0\cdots P_n}(t)=(1-t)B_{P_0\cdots P_{n-1}}(t)+tB_{P_1\cdots P_n}(t)$$From this definition we can see that the expression of the point on curve basically contains an expansion of $((1-t)+t)^n$ and the corresponding $P_i$ term, as shown below.
- **Explicit definition**: expanding the recursive expression above we gets $$B(t)=\sum_{i=0}^mC_n^it^i(1-t)^{n-i}P_i=\sum_{i=0}^nb_{i,n}(t)P_i$$where $b_{i,n}$ denotes the Bernstein basis polynomial. [[Functional Approximation]]
- **Matrix definition**: the above expression can also be organized into a matrix product$$\begin{align}B(t)&=\begin{pmatrix}P_0&P_1&\cdots&P_n\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}b_{0,n}(t)\\b_{2,n}(t)\\\vdots\\b_{n,n}(t)\end{pmatrix}\\&=\begin{pmatrix}P_0&P_1&\cdots&P_n\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}C_{00}&0&0&\cdots&0\\C_{10}&C_{11}&0&\cdots&0\\\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&&\vdots\\\vdots&\vdots&&\ddots&0\\C_{n0}&C_{n1}&\cdots&C_{n,n-1}&C_{nn}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1\\t\\\vdots\\t^n\end{pmatrix}\end{align}$$where the $C_{ij}$, whose sum for each fixed $j$ is the coefficient $C_j$ in $B(t)=\sum_{j=0}^n t^jC_j$, can be expressed as  $$C_{ij}=\frac{(-1)^{i+j}n!}{(n-j)!i!(j-i)!}$$
### Bézier spline
For better local control and easier computation, we consider to join many Bézier curves together end-by-end to obtain a longer spline. In this case for each spline we'll have two **joints/knots** and two **control points**. We denoted two neighboring set of points to be $(P_i)_{0\le i\le 3}$ and $(P_j)_{3\le j\le 6}$.
- **Continuity**: except for $C^0$ we'd also require the curve to be $C^1$ or $C^2$, making the curve more smooth, but also posing more constraints to the coefficients ([[Smooth Curve]]). Their relations goes as follows (we only consider regular curves). $$\begin{CD}C_0@<<<C_1@<<<C_2@<<<\cdots\\@|@VVV@VVV@VVV\\G_0@<<<G_1@<<<G_2@<<<\cdots\end{CD}$$
	- **$G_1$ (tangent continuity)**: requires neighboring control points to be co-linear.
	- **$C_1$ (velocity continuity)**: requires neighboring control points to mirror each other.
	- **$C_2$ (acceleration continuity)**: requires $P_5=P_1+4(P_3-P_2)$. In this case only $P_1,P_2$ are left free for control.
