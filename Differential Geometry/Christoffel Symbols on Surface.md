Given a [[Smooth Surface]] parametrized by $S:X=X(u,v)$, since the vectors $\set{X_u,X_v,\mathbf n}$ forms a local frame, we can set the representation under this frame as $$\begin{aligned} X_{uu} &= \Gamma_{uu}^u X_u + \Gamma_{uu}^v X_v + L \mathbf{n} \\ X_{uv} &= \Gamma_{uv}^u X_u + \Gamma_{uv}^v X_v + M \mathbf{n} \\ X_{vv} &= \Gamma_{vv}^u X_u + \Gamma_{vv}^v X_v + N \mathbf{n} \end{aligned}$$where $L,M,N$ are the coefficients of the second fundamental form. These $\Gamma_{\bullet\bullet}^\bullet$ are called the **Christoffel symbols of the second kind**. Its generalization can be found in [[Riemannian Manifold]].
- **Geometric intuition**: for a particle moving on $S$, $X_{ii}$ represents acceleration. $\Gamma_{\bullet\bullet}^\bullet$ represents the portion of acceleration that remains tangent to the surface. A curve is a **geodesic** if its tangential acceleration is zero, which leads directly to the geodesic differential equations.
## Properties
**Christoffel formulas**: the Christoffel symbols are given by $$\begin{pmatrix}\Gamma_{uu}^u\\\Gamma_{uu}^v\end{pmatrix}=\one^{-1}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{2}E_u\\F_u-\frac{1}{2}E_v\end{pmatrix},\quad\begin{pmatrix}\Gamma_{uv}^u\\\Gamma_{uv}^v\end{pmatrix}=\one^{-1}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{2}E_v\\\frac{1}{2}G_u\end{pmatrix},\quad \begin{pmatrix}\Gamma_{vv}^u\\\Gamma_{vv}^v\end{pmatrix}=\one^{-1}\begin{pmatrix}F_v-\frac{1}{2}G_u\\\frac{1}{2}G_v\end{pmatrix}$$**Proof**: taking inner product between the defining equations above and $X_u,X_v$ we get $$\begin{cases}X_{uu}\cdot X_u=\Gamma_{uu}^uE+\Gamma_{uu}^vF\\X_{uu}\cdot X_v=\Gamma_{uu}^uF+\Gamma_{uu}^vG\end{cases} \quad\begin{cases}X_{uv}\cdot X_u=\Gamma_{uv}^uE+\Gamma_{uv}^vF\\X_{uu}\cdot X_v=\Gamma_{uv}^uF+\Gamma_{uv}^vG\end{cases} \quad\begin{cases}X_{vv}\cdot X_u=\Gamma_{vv}^uE+\Gamma_{vv}^vF\\X_{v}\cdot X_v=\Gamma_{vv}^uF+\Gamma_{vv}^vG\end{cases}$$On the other hand, observe that LHS can be represented by partial derivatives of $E,F,G$, hence the above equations forms three linear system in $\Gamma_{\bullet\bullet}^\bullet$ with coefficients being functions of $E,F,G$. The formula follows from the Cramer's rule ([[Solving Linear System]]).
- **Christoffel as an intrinsic property**: since the Christoffel symbols are totally determined by the coefficients of the first fundamental form, which is intrinsic, we know that $\Gamma_{ij}^k$ are also intrinsic properties of a surface. 
- **Codazzi & Gauss equations**: by Schwarz's theorem ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) we have $(X_{uu})_v=(X_{uv})_v, (X_{vv})_u=(X_{uv})_v$. After expanding the partial differentials, by comparing the coefficients of $\mathbf n$ we get the **Codazzi equations**:  $$\begin{aligned} L_v - M_u &= L\Gamma_{uv}^u + M(\Gamma_{uv}^v - \Gamma_{uu}^u) - N\Gamma_{uu}^v \\ M_v - N_u &= L\Gamma_{vv}^u + M(\Gamma_{vv}^v - \Gamma_{uv}^u) - N\Gamma_{uv}^v \end{aligned}$$And by comparing the $X_u,X_v$ terms we get the **Gauss equation**: $$\begin{align}EK& =  (\Gamma_{uu}^v)_v - (\Gamma_{uv}^v)_u + \Gamma_{uu}^u \Gamma_{uv}^v + \Gamma_{uu}^v \Gamma_{vv}^v - \Gamma_{uv}^u \Gamma_{uu}^v - (\Gamma_{uv}^v)^2\\ FK& =  (\Gamma_{uv}^u)_u - (\Gamma_{uu}^u)_v + \Gamma_{uu}^v \Gamma_{uv}^u-\Gamma_{uu}^v \Gamma_{vv}^u \\ FK& =  (\Gamma_{uv}^v)_v - (\Gamma_{vv}^v)_u + \Gamma_{uv}^u \Gamma_{uv}^v-\Gamma_{vv}^u \Gamma_{uu}^v \\ GK& =  (\Gamma_{vv}^u)_u - (\Gamma_{uv}^u)_v + \Gamma_{vv}^u \Gamma_{uu}^u + \Gamma_{vv}^v \Gamma_{uv}^u - (\Gamma_{uv}^u)^2 - \Gamma_{uv}^v\Gamma_{vv}^u \end{align}$$The derivation of these last four formulas requires some computation involving definition of the Gaussian curvature $K$ ([[Smooth Surface]]). 
- **Gauss's Theorema Egregium**: the Gaussian curvature $K$ of a surface is an intrinsic invariant.
  **Proof**: from the above formulas we know that $K$ can be computed from any one of $E,F,G$ and the Christoffel symbols. These values are all intrinsic, hence so is $K$ itself.  
## Fundamental theorem of surfaces
**Fundamental theorem of surfaces**: let $E, F, G,L, M, N$ be smooth functions defined on a simply connected domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that:
1. **Positive definiteness**: $E , G > 0$, and $EG - F^2 > 0$. 
2. **Compatibility condition**: the functions satisfy Gauss equation and Codazzi equations.
Then, there exists a surface $X: D \to \mathbb{R}^3$ unique up to a rigid motion s.t. $E, F, G$ and $L, M, N$ are its first and second fundamental forms, respectively.
