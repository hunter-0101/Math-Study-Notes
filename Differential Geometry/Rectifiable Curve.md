Given $\Gamma:\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t)),t\in(a,b)$ we'd like to know whether the length can be calculated as $$L=\int_a^b(x'(t)^2+y'(t)^2)^{1/2}dt$$Notice that when $x=y=c$ the Cantor function ([[Special Function Gallery]]) the equality is obviously violated.
- **Rectifiability criterion**: if $x(t),y(t)$ are AC then $\Gamma$ is rectifiable, and its length is given by the above formula.
  **Proof**:
