A **metric tensor** on a [[Smooth Manifold]] $M$ at $p\in M$ is a [[Bilinear Form]] on [[Tangent Bundle]] $$g_p:T_pM\times T_pM\to\mathbb R$$that is **non-degenerated**, and **symmetric**. A **metric tensor field** is a collection $g=\set{g_p:p\in M}$that is **smooth** in the sense that the function $$g(X,Y):M\to\mathbb R,\quad p\mapsto g_p(X_p,Y_p)$$is smooth for any pair $X,Y\in\mathfrak X(M)$ ([[Tangent Bundle]]). A manifold with a metric tensor is called a pseudo-[[Riemannian Manifold]]. 
- **Motivation**: various practical and theoretical problems (e.g., calculating geodesics) requires a metric structure on smooth manifold, i.e., a measure of length of curves. Metric tensor is how we model and formalize the concept of length in an elegant way.
	- **Why inner product is better than norm**: for constructing metric structure on an [[Inner Product Space]], inner product is usually a better choice compared to norm because other than the length of a single vector, an inner product also tells us how two different directions relate to one another. We're endowed with further structures like angles and orthogonality. 
- **Metric components**: given any frame ([[Vector Bundle]]) $F=(X_1,\cdots,X_n)$ the components of the metric tensor $g$ are given by $$g_{ij}(F)=g(X_i,X_j),\quad\forall 1\le i,j\le n$$which form a symmetric **metric [[Matrix]]** $G(F)=(g_{ij}(F))$. 
	- **Metric components under local coordinates**: under $(x^1,\cdots,x^n)$ we have $$F=\paren{\pard{}{x^1},\cdots,\pard{}{x^n}}\imply g_{ij}(F)=g\paren{\pard{}{x^i},\pard{}{x^j}}$$Therefore its value given two tangent vectors is $$g_p\left(\alpha^T\nabla_x,\beta^T\nabla_x\right) = \alpha^TG_p\beta$$
	- **Smoothness**: obviously the requirement that $g$ is smooth is equivalent to all its components in $G$ being smooth in $p$. 
- **Inverse metric**: we have $G_p\in\gl(n,\mathbb R),\forall p\in M$ by non-degeneracy, hence we can define its inverse metric $g^{-1}$ by its components $$(g^{ij})= (g_{ij})^{-1}$$We can easily verify that the indices satisfy the defining identity $$g^{ik} g_{kj} = \delta^i_j$$
## Levi-Civita connection
Given $(M,g)$ a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, the **Levi-Civita connection** on $M$ is a [[Covariant Derivative]] $\nabla$ on the [[Tangent Bundle]] that satisfies: 
1. **Compatibility with metric**: we have $$\nabla g=0\qiffq X(g(Y,Z))=f(\nabla_XY,Z)+g(Y,\nabla_XZ),\quad\forall X,Y,Z\in\Gamma(TM)$$This is the Leibniz rule for the covariant derivative applied to the metric, ensuring that the inner product $g(Y,Z)$ remains constant as $Y,Z$ are parallel transported along $X$. 
2. **Torsion-free**: we have $$\nabla_XY-\nabla_YX=[X,Y],\quad\forall X,Y\in\Gamma(TM)$$where $[X,Y]$ is the Lie bracket.
