A **metric tensor** on a [[Smooth Manifold]] $M$ at $p\in M$ is a **bilinear form** ([[Quadratic Form]]) $$g_p:T_pM\times T_pM\to\mathbb R$$that is **non-degenerated**, **symmetric**. A **metric tensor field** is a collection of metric tensors $$g=\set{g_p:p\in M}$$that is **smooth** in the sense that the function $$g(X,Y):M\to\mathbb R,\quad p\mapsto g_p(X_p,Y_p)$$is smooth for any pair $X,Y\in\mathfrak X(M)$ ([[Differential Calculus on Smooth Manifold]]). 
- **Discussion on positive definiteness**: a positive definite metric tensor is called a Riemannian metric ([[Riemannian Manifold]]), otherwise it's called a **pseudo-Riemannian metric**. 
- **Metric components**: given any frame ([[Vector Bundle]]) $F=(X_1,\cdots,X_n)$ the components of the metric tensor $g$ are given by $$g_{ij}(F)=g(X_i,X_j),\quad\forall 1\le i,j\le n$$which form a symmetric **metric [[Matrix]]** $G(F)=(g_{ij}(F))$. 
	- **Metric components under local coordinates**: under $(x^1,\cdots,x^n)$ we have $$F=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^1},\cdots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right),\quad g_{ij}(F)=g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i},\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right)$$Therefore its value given two tangent vectors is $$g_p\left(\alpha^T\nabla_x,\beta^T\nabla_x\right) = \alpha^TG_p\beta$$
	- **Smoothness**: obviously the requirement that $g$ is smooth is equivalent to all its components in $G$ being smooth in $p$. 
- **Inverse metric**: we have $G_p\in\gl(n,\mathbb R),\forall p\in M$ by non-degeneracy, hence we can define its inverse metric $g^{-1}$ by its components $$(g^{ij})= (g_{ij})^{-1}$$We can easily verify that the indices satisfy the defining identity $$g^{ik} g_{kj} = \delta^i_j$$
