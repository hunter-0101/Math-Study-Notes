**Discussion**: integral theory on smooth manifold can basically be categorized into two parts: the **topological part** that ensures its similarity with Euclidean space, and a "**bridge**" that connects it with [[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]] under [[Riemann Integral]]:
- **Topological part**: as in [[Topological Manifold]], local Euclidean-ness ensures we can do calculus locally, and Hausdorff and second countability ensures things like uniqueness of limits, coordination, partition of unity, etc. Further, as in [[Smooth Manifold]], global smooth structure ensures that local integrals are consistent across the entire manifold. 
- **Bridge**: the smooth structure (i.e., the $C^\infty$ atlas) together with well-behaved transition functions makes it easy to directly translate things from [[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]] directly onto manifolds.
**Motivation for orientation**: by looking at $\mathbb R^d$ for $d=1,2,3$ we notice that orientation can be clarified via an **ordered basis** $e=(e_{i_1},\cdots,e_{i_m})$ on $TM$, and we can define a equivalence [[Relation]] $$e\sim u \iff \det A>0\quad\text{where}\quad e=Au$$This relates orientations with [[Exterior Algebra]] via an alternating property.

## Orientation
Given [[Smooth Manifold]] $M$ a **pointwise orientation** $\mu_p$ is an equivalence class of ordered global frame $[X_p]=[(X_{i,p})],X_{i,p}\in T_pM$, with equivalence [[Relation]] on $U\subset M$ given by $$X\sim Y\quad\iff\quad\det A_p>0\text{ where }X_p=A_pY_p\quad\forall p\in U$$We say that $\mu$ is **continuous** at $p$ if it's represented by a continuous frame ([[Vector Bundle]]) on some neighborhood $U$ of $p$. $\mu$ that's continuous on $M$ is called an **orientation** on $M$. 
- **Continuity of orientation and frame**: note that we only require $\mu$ to be **represented by** a continuous frame locally on each chart of an atlas. There is no guarantee that it can be represented by a continuous global frame, or even that the representation itself is continuous.
- **Number of orientations**: given $M$ connected there are exactly two different orientations. 
  **Proof**: pick two orientations $\mu,\nu$, then by definition we can define $$f(p)=\begin{cases}1, &\mu_p=\nu_p\\-1,&\text{otherwise}\end{cases},\quad\forall p\in M$$pick $U\subset M$ on which we have the representation $\mu=[(X_i)],\nu=[(Y_i)]$, and let $Y_j=\sum a_j^iX_i$, then by [[Vector Bundle]] we have $a_j^i\in C(U)\Longrightarrow\det[a_j^i]\in C(U)$, hence by definition $f(p)$ is constant on $U$. Since $M$ is connected we must have $f$ constant on $M$, i.e., $\mu=\pm\nu$.
	- **Intuition**: since $\beta\in A_m(V),u_j=\sum a_j^iv_i\Longrightarrow\beta(u)=\det[a_j^i]\cdot\beta(v)$ by definition ([[Exterior Algebra]]), we have that $u\sim v\iff\sgn\beta(u)=\sgn\beta(v)$. We say that $\beta\in A_m(V)$ **specifies** (**determines**) the orientation $v$ if $\beta(v)>0$. Further, by linearity of covector, $$\beta\sim\beta'\quad\iff\quad\beta'=a\beta\quad\text{for some}\quad a>0$$In this way given a specific ordered basis the linear isomorphism $\bigwedge^m(V^*)\cong\mathbb R$ identifies non-zero k-covectors with $\mathbb R^\times$, yielding two connected components.
- **Orientation via differential form**: a pointwise orientation $\mu$ is continuous on $M$ iff each $p\in M$ has a coordinate neighborhood $(U,x^i)$ s.t. $dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^m(\mu)>0$ on $U$.
  **Proof**: for $\mu$ is continuous on $(U,x^i)$ pick $\mu=[Y]=[(Y_i)]$ a continuous local frame. Now denote $\omega=dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^m$ and assume $Y_i=\sum a_i^j\partial_j$, then by [[Exterior Algebra]] $$\omega(Y)=\det[a_i^j]\omega(\partial_1,\cdots,\partial_m)=\det[a_i^j]$$since a frame is nowhere vanishing we have $\omega(Y)=\det[a_i^j]\neq0$, and by continuity of $\det$ we have $\sgn\omega(Y)$ constant, hence $\Rightarrow$ is valid. For $\Leftarrow$, just notice that the assumption ensures $\mu=[(\partial_1,\cdots,\partial_m)]$ on any coordinate neighborhood about each $p\in M$.
	- **Intuition**: as discussed at the beginning, continuity of $\mu$ is not about the continuity of each coordinate in the representation frame, but about continuity of order of the frame. Positivity of value under $dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^m$ says exactly this ([[Exterior Algebra]]): even permutation is always indistinguishable under alternating map.
	- **Orientability**: $M$ is orientable iff it has a $C^\infty$ non-vanishing top form. 
	  **Proof**: for $\Rightarrow$ pick $\mu$ continuous and take at each point a top form $\omega=\bigwedge_{i=1}^mdx^i$, then $\omega(\mu)>0$ by the above result. Take a $C^\infty$ partition of unity $\set{\rho_\alpha}$ ([[Smooth Manifold]]) subordinate to $\set{U_\alpha}$ that covers $M$, then $\sum\rho_\alpha\omega_\alpha$ satisfies the requirements. For $\Leftarrow$ at each $p$ just pick a local frame $X_p=(X_{1,p},\cdots,X_{m,p})$ on $U$ s.t. $\omega_p(X_p)>0$. Since $$\omega=fdx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^m,\quad f\in C^\infty(U),f\neq0$$hence $\sgn f$ is constant, which means we can always pick proper $x^i$ s.t. $f>0$, to which we can apply the theorem above to prove that $\mu=[X]$ is continuous.
	- **Orientation specified by differential form**: for two non-vanishing $C^\infty$ top forms $\omega,\omega'$ let $$\omega\sim\omega'\quad\iff\quad\omega=f\omega',\quad f\in C^\infty,f>0$$associate to each orientation $\mu$ on connected orientable $M$ a class of non-vanishing $C^\infty$ top form $\omega(\mu)>0$, then we get a bijective correspondence $\mu\longleftrightarrow[\omega]$. We say that $[\omega]$ **specifies** $\mu$, and $[\omega]$ is the **orientation form** of $\mu$. The pair $(M,[\omega])$ is called an **oriented manifold**, usually abbreviated as $M$.
	- **Orientation under diffeomorphism**: a diffeomorphism $F:(M,[\omega_M])\to(N,[\omega_N])$  is **orientation-preserving** if $[\omega_N]=[F_*\omega_M]$, and **orientation-reversing** if $[\omega_N]=[-F_*\omega_M]$. It's obvious by definition that the above is equivalent to $\det J_F>/<0$.
- **Orientation via atlas**: $\mathfrak A$ is oriented if $\det\left[\frac{\partial y^j}{\partial x^i}\right]>0$ on $U\cap V$ for any pair $(U,x^i),(V,y^j)\in\mathfrak A$. It's obvious that $M$ is orientable iff it has an oriented atlas.
	- **Equivalent atlas**: define the equivalence [[Relation]] $$\set{(U_\alpha,\phi_\alpha)}\sim\set{(V_\beta,\psi_\beta)}\quad\iff\quad \det J_{\phi_\alpha\circ\psi_\beta^{-1}}>0,\forall\alpha,\beta$$which yields another bijective correspondence $\mu\longleftrightarrow[\mathfrak A]$.
- **Boundary orientation**: for oriented $(M,[\omega])$ and $X$ an outward-pointing vector field the interior multiplication $$\imath_X\omega:(v_2,\cdots,v_m)\mapsto\omega(X,v_2,\cdots,v_m)$$is a smooth non-vanishing top form on $\partial M$, hence an orientation.
	- **Outward vector first**: take $X_p\in T_pM$ an outward-pointing vector, an ordered set $(v_1,\cdots,v_{m-1})$ represents the boundary orientation at $p$ iff $(X_p,v_1,\cdots,v_{m-1})$ represents the orientation at $p$ for $M$.
	- **Motivation**: there are actually several other ways to define boundary orientation, some even not equivalent from the above. We choose this one because it allows us to avoid the annoying minus sign in expressions like Stokes' theorem.
## Integration on manifold
To integrate a form on a manifold several conditions are needed:
1. **Orientation**: the manifold must be oriented.
2. **Top form**: nn any manifold we can only integrate the top forms.
3. **Compact support**: the integrand must have compact support.
Now given $(M,\mu)$ denote $\Omega_c^k(M)$ the set of smooth $k$-forms of compact support, for chart $(U,\phi)$ and $\omega\in\Omega_c^m(U)$ define its integral on $U$ as $$\int_U\omega=\int_{\phi(U)}(\phi^{-1})^*\omega$$since transition functions are orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms ([[Differential Calculus on Smooth Manifold]]), by change of variable formula ([[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) we know that the integral is well-defined. Further, for $\omega\in\Omega_c^m(M)$ by compactness we can take a partition of unity $\set{\rho_\alpha}$ subordinate to $\mathfrak A$, and define $$\int_M\omega=\int_M\sum_\alpha\rho_\alpha\omega=\sum_\alpha\int_{U_\alpha}\rho_\alpha\omega$$This is well-defined because the summation is a locally finite ([[Smooth Manifold]]), and is independent of partition of unity: $$\sum_\alpha\int_{U_\alpha}\rho_\alpha\omega=\sum_\alpha\int_{U_\alpha}\rho_\alpha\sum_\beta\eta_\beta\omega=\sum_{\alpha,\beta}\int_{U_\alpha\cap V_\beta}\rho_\alpha\eta_\beta\omega=\cdots=\sum_\beta\int_{V_\beta}\eta_\beta\omega$$
- **Reversed orientation**: we have that $$\int_{-M}\omega=-\int_M\omega$$as a simple consequence of the change of variable formula.
## Stokes' theorem
For $(m-1)$-form $\omega$ we write $\int_{\partial M}\omega$ instead of $\int_{\partial M}\iota^*\omega$ as a convention. Then for any such $\omega$ that is compactly supported on oriented $M$ of dimension $m$, we have $$\int_Md\omega=\int_{\partial M}\omega$$To show this we pick a partition of unity $\set{\rho_\alpha}$ on $\partial M$ and notice that $$\begin{align}\int_{\partial M}\omega&=\int_{\partial M}\sum_\alpha\rho_\alpha\omega&\sum_\alpha\rho_\alpha=1\\&=\sum_\alpha\int_{\partial M}\rho_\alpha\omega\\&=\sum_\alpha\int_{\partial U_\alpha}\rho_\alpha\omega &\supp\rho_\alpha\omega\subset U_\alpha\\&=\sum_\alpha\int_{U_\alpha}d(\rho_\alpha\omega)&\text{Stokes' theorem for }U_\alpha\\&=\sum_\alpha\int_Md(\rho_\alpha\omega)&\supp d(\rho_\alpha\omega)\subset U_\alpha\\&=\int_Md\left(\sum_\alpha\rho_\alpha\omega\right)\\&=\int_Md\omega\end{align}$$Hence it suffices to show the Stokes' theorem for $\mathbb R^m$ and $\mathcal H^m$, which is essentially a simple calculation via [[Modern Calculus on Euclidean Space]].
