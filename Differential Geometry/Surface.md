Subset $S \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is a **regular surface** if, for every point $p \in S$, there exists a neighborhood $V \subset S$ of $p$ and a **parametrization** $X: U \to V$, where $U\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ (with coordinates $u, v$), such that:
1. **Smoothness**: $X$ is a $C^\infty$ (or $C^k, k \ge 2$) map.
2. **Homeomorphism**: $X$ is a homeomorphism ([[Continuous Function]])
3. **Regularity**: $\rank J_X(u, v)=2,\forall(u,v)\in U$, i.e., the partial derivatives $X_u,X_v$ are linearly independent. Note that we have $T_pS=\span(X_u,X_v)$ ([[Differential Calculus on Smooth Manifold]]) at $p=X(u, v)$. 
In this way a 3D surface $S$ can be described by $$S\ni(x,y,z)=(x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v))$$which is usually called a **parametric surface**.
- **Other definition**: there are other definitions available from different perspectives: 
	- **Monge patch**: a **simple parametrization** where $S$ is locally the graph of a differentiable function: $$X(u, v) = (u, v, f(u, v))$$where $f: U \to \mathbb{R}$ is a $C^\infty$ function. Since $X_u = (1, 0, f_u)$ and $X_v = (0, 1, f_v)$, their cross product is $X_u \times X_v = (-f_u, -f_v, 1)$, which is never zero, ensuring regularity.
	- **Implicit function**: locally, $S$ is defined as the level set of a differentiable function $F: W \to \mathbb{R}$ where $W$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^3$: $$S = \{ (x, y, z) \in W \mid F(x, y, z) = c \}$$where $c$ is a constant, and the gradient $\nabla F$ is non-zero at every point of $S$: $$\nabla F(p) \ne \mathbf{0}, \quad \forall p \in S$$In this case, $\nabla F(p)$ is the normal vector to $S$ at $p$.
## Fundamental forms
There are two fundamental forms, with one being intrinsic and the other being extrinsic, describing different properties of the surface. Below we consider a parametric surface $X(u,v)$.
- **First fundamental form (intrinsic)**: the inner product of tangent vectors are given by $$\begin{align}&\braket{aX_u+bX_v,cX_u+dX_v}\\=&ac\braket{X_u,X_u}+(ad+bc)\braket{X_u,X_v}+bd\braket{X_v,X_v}\\=&Eac+F(ad+bc)+Gbd\end{align}$$where we abbreviated the inner products as the **coefficients of the first fundamental form** $$E=\braket{X_u,X_u},\quad F=\braket{X_u,X_v},\quad G=\braket{X_v,X_v}$$This form can be represented by [[Matrix]] in local coordinates as $$\one:T_pS\times T_pS\to\mathbb R,\quad\one\left(x^T\nabla X,y^T\nabla X\right)=x^T\begin{pmatrix}E&F\\F&G\end{pmatrix}y$$For simplicity we'll denote $\one(w,w)=\one(w)$. 
	- **Intuition**: by discussion above, $\one$ actually gives the restriction of the standard inner product on [[Euclidean Space]] to $T_pS$ in its local coordinates, in the sense that $$\one(x^T\nabla X,y^T\nabla X)=\Braket{x^T\nabla X,y^T\nabla X},\quad\forall x,y\in\mathbb R^2$$The first fundamental form completely describes the metric properties of a surface as a standalone manifold, hence enables the calculation of geometric objects like length or area. 
- **Second fundamental form (extrinsic)**: the second-order terms in the Taylor expansion ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) of $S$ at $p$ is given by $$\two=Ldu^2+2Mdudv+Ndv^2$$with $L,M,N$ being the **coefficients of the second fundamental form** defined as $$L=\braket{X_{uu},\mathbf n},\quad M=\braket{X_{uv},\mathbf n},\quad N=\braket{X_{vv},\mathbf n}\where\mathbf n=\frac{X_u\times X_v}{\|X_u\times X_v\|}$$Similarly as above, this form can be represented in local coordinates as $$\two:T_pS\times T_pS\to\mathbb R,\quad\two\left(x^T\nabla X,y^T\nabla X\right)=x^T\begin{pmatrix}L&M\\M&N\end{pmatrix}y$$For simplicity we'll denote $\two(w,w)=\two(w)$.
	- **Intuition**: the second fundamental form describes how "curved" the embedding is, in other words, how the surface is located in the ambient space.
We also define the **shape operator** measuring the rate of change of the unit normal along $w$ by $$S_p:T_pS\to T_pS,\quad S_p(w)=-\nabla_w\mathbf n$$where $\nabla_w\mathbf n$ is the directional derivative of $\mathbf n$ in direction $w$ ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]). Using the above two forms we have the representation of $S$ under basis $\nabla X$ as $$S=\one^{-1}\two=\begin{pmatrix}E&F\\F&G\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\begin{pmatrix}L&M\\M&N\end{pmatrix}$$**Proof**: by definition of [[Matrix]] representation of linear operator ([[Vector Space]]), write $$\begin{pmatrix}SX_u&SX_v\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}X_u&X_v\end{pmatrix}S\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\begin{pmatrix}X_u\\X_v\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}-\nabla\mathbf nX_u&-\nabla\mathbf n X_v\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}X_u\\X_v\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}X_u&X_v\end{pmatrix}S$$By arithmetic properties of matrix and we get $$\begin{pmatrix}\braket{X_u,-\nabla\mathbf n X_u}&\braket{X_u,-\nabla\mathbf n X_v}\\\braket{X_v,-\nabla\mathbf n X_u}&\braket{X_v,-\nabla\mathbf n X_v}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\braket{X_u, X_u}&\braket{X_u, X_v}\\\braket{X_u,X_v}&\braket{X_v, X_v}\end{pmatrix}S$$Now notice that $\nabla\mathbf n X_u=\mathbf n_u$ as a direct corollary of chain rule, while by orthogonality and [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]] we have $$\braket{X_u,\mathbf n}=0\implies\frac{\partial}{\partial u}\braket{X_u,\mathbf n}=0\implies\braket{X_u,\mathbf n_u}=-\braket{X_{uu},\mathbf n}$$By substituting these two equalities into the expression we finally get $$\two=\one S\quad\iff\quad S=\one^{-1}\two$$which completes the proof. 
## Curvature of surface
For $p\in S$ there are a family of normal planes $\pi\perp T_pS$. The first curvature ([[Curve]]) of the section $\gamma=S\cap\pi_w$, where $\pi$ is the plane specified by its normal vector $w\in T_pS$, is called the **normal curvature** in direction $w$, given by $$k_n(w)=\frac{\two(w,w)}{\one(w,w)},\quad\forall w\in T_pS$$**Proof**: take a regular [[Curve]] $\gamma$ that specifies a normal curvature $\kappa$, then $\kappa=\|\gamma''(0)\|$. Write $$\gamma''(0)=\kappa_g\mathbf t+\kappa_n\mathbf n$$where $\kappa_g,\kappa_n$ are the **geodesic curvature** and normal curvature, then $\kappa_n=\braket{\gamma''(0),\mathbf n}$. Notice that $$\begin{align}&\gamma(s)=X(u(s),v(s))\imply\gamma'(s)=X_uu'+X_vv'\\\imply&\gamma''(s)=\frac{d}{ds}\gamma'(s)=X_{uu}(u')^s+2X_{uv}u'v'+X_{vv}(v')^2+X_uu''+X_vv''\end{align}$$Now since the unit tangent vector has local coordinates $$w=\gamma'(0)=X_uu'(0)+X_vv'(0)$$By substituting $\gamma''(0)$ into the expression we get $$\begin{align}k_n&= \braket{\gamma''(0), \mathbf{n}} \\&= \braket{X_{uu}(u')^2 + 2X_{uv} u'v' + X_{vv}(v')^2, \mathbf{n}} + \braket{X_u u'' + X_v v'', \mathbf{n}}\\&=\braket{\mathbf{X}_{uu}, \mathbf{n}}(u')^2 + 2\braket{\mathbf{X}_{uv}, \mathbf{n}}u'v' + \braket{\mathbf{X}_{vv}, \mathbf{n}}(v')^2\\&=L(u')^2+2Mu'v'+N(v')^2\end{align}$$and by the expression of second fundamental form we have $$k_n=\two(w,w),\quad\forall w\in T_pS,\|w\|=1$$Since we've chosen $w$ to be a unit vector, by homogeneity we have $$k_n=\frac{\two(w,w)}{\one(w,w)},\quad\forall w\in T_pS$$using the fact that $\one(w,w)=\|w\|^2$. 
- **Principal curvature**: we define the principal curvatures as the extreme of normal curvatures, which are given by $$\max_{w\in T_pS}\kappa_n(w)=\kappa_1,\quad\min_{w\in T_pS}\kappa_n(w)=\kappa_2\where \sigma(S)=(\kappa_1,\kappa_2)$$Their corresponding eigenvectors are called the **principal directions**. 
  **Proof**: denote $w=x^T\nabla X$, then we wanna find extreme values of $$k_n(w)=\frac{\two(w,w)}{\one(w,w)}=\frac{x^T\two x}{x^T\one x}\where x\in\mathbb R^2$$By discussion on generalized Rayleigh quotient ([[Eigendecomposition]]) we have $$k_n(w)\in[\lambda_\min,\lambda_\max]\where\lambda_\min,\lambda_\max\in\sigma\left(\one^{-1}\two\right)=\sigma(S)$$with extremes achieved at the corresponding eigenvectors, completing the proof. 
- **Gaussian curvature**: the Gaussian curvature is defined as $$K=\det S=\kappa_1\kappa_2$$using the coefficients of the fundamental forms we have $$K = \frac{\det\two}{\det\one} =\frac{L N - M^2}{E G - F^2}$$
	- **Theorema Egregium**: $K$ depends **only** on the coefficients of the $\one$, the tuple $(E, F, G)$ and their derivatives. In particular, we have $$K=\frac{R_{1212}}{\det\one}$$where $R_{1212}$ is a component of the Riemann curvature tensor, which is constructed entirely from $I$ and its derivatives. Therefore, $K$ is an **intrinsic invariant** of the surface. 
- **Mean curvature**: the mean curvature, literally, is defined as $$H=\frac{1}{2}\tr S=\frac{\kappa_1+\kappa_2}{2}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{EN-2FM+GL}{EG-F^2}$$Surfaces with $H=0$ are minimal surfaces, being critical points of th area functional.
