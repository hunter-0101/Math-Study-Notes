A **Riemannian manifold** $(M,g)$ is a [[Smooth Manifold]] $M$ equipped with a **Riemannian metric** $g$ that is a **positive definition** [[Metric Tensor]] $$g_p:T_pM\times T_pM\to\mathbb R$$Intuitively it serves as a smooth assignment of an inner product ([[Inner Product Space]]) on the tangent spaces.
- **Local coordinates representation**: the local coordinates representation is exactly the same as general [[Metric Tensor]]. The metric matrix $G=(g_{ij})$ is defined also the same.
- **Existence of Riemannian metric**: every smooth manifold $M$ admits a Riemannian metric.
  **Proof**: consider $\set{(U_\alpha,\varphi_\alpha)}_{\alpha\in A}$ a locally finite atlas, and $\set{\tau_\alpha}_{\alpha\in A}$ a differentiable partition of unity subordinate to the given atlas ([[Smooth Manifold]]). Define $g$ by $$g=\sum_{\alpha\in A}\tau_\alpha\cdot\tilde g_\alpha\where\tilde g_\alpha=\varphi_\alpha^*g^\text{can}$$Here $g^\text{can}$ is the Euclidean metric ([[Euclidean Space]]) on $\mathbb R^n$. Since $\supp\tau_\alpha\subset U_\alpha$ we have $\tau_\alpha\tilde g_\alpha$ defined and smooth on $M$, and vanishes outside $M$. Since the atlas is locally finite, the sum is well-defined at every point. It's straightforward to check that $g$ is a Riemannian metric. 
- **Length of [[Curve]]**: given a curve $\gamma:I\to M$ its length is given by $$L(\gamma)=\int_I\sqrt{g(\gamma'(t),\gamma'(t))}dt$$Note that it's **invariant under change of coordinates** because given $x^i,y^j$ we have $$\frac{dy^k}{dt}=\frac{\partial y^k}{\partial x^i}\frac{dx^j}{dt},\quad\tilde g_{kl}=\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial y^k}\frac{\partial x^j}{\partial y^l}g_{ij}\imply g_{ij} \frac{dx^i}{dt} \frac{dx^j}{dt} = \tilde{g}_{kl} \frac{dy^k}{dt} \frac{dy^l}{dt}$$by the chain rule ([[Differential Calculus on Smooth Manifold]]).
- **Volume form**: on an $m$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, the metric naturally induces a canonical volume $m$-form $\mu_g$ given by $$\mu_g = \sqrt{\det(g_{ij})} \, dx^1 \wedge \dots \wedge dx^m$$The volume of a measurable $A \subset M$ is then defined by the integral: $$\vol(A) = \int_A \mu_g$$as defined in [[Integral Calculus on Smooth Manifold]]. 
	- **Invariance under coordinate transform**: for $(x^i),(y^j)$ by [[Exterior Algebra]] we have $$dy^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dy^n=\det J\cdot x^1\wedge\cdots\wedge x^m\where J=\left(\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^j}\right)_{1\le i,j\le m}$$While the metric matrix under change of coordinate is $$\tilde G=J^{-T}GJ^{-1}$$therefore the volume under two local coordinates are $$\tilde\mu_g=\sqrt{\det\tilde G}dy^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dy^m=\sqrt{\frac{1}{(\det J)^2}\det G}\cdot\det J\cdot dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^m=\mu_g$$Therefore the integral $\vol(A)$ is invariant to the change of local coordinates. 
- **[[Metric Space]] structure**: given a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ we can define $$d_g(p,q)=\inf\Set{L(\gamma):\gamma\text{ regular with }\gamma(0)=p,\gamma(1)=q}$$where $L(\gamma)$ is the length ([[Curve]]), then $(M,d_g)$ is a metric space whose induced [[Metric Topology]] coincides with the topology on $M$. 
## Geodesic
A smooth [[Curve]] $\gamma: I \to M$ is a **geodesic** if $$\nabla_{\gamma'(t)}\gamma'(t) = 0,\quad\forall t\in I$$Intuitively, it's say that its acceleration is a multiple of the normal vector, which means the curve is "straightest" in the manifold.
- **Geodesic equation**: in a local coordinate chart $(U, x^1, \dots, x^m)$, where $\gamma(t) = (x^1(t), \dots, x^m(t))$, the vanishing covariant derivative leads to the geodesic equation: $$\frac{d^2 x^k}{d t^2} + \Gamma^k_{ij} \frac{d x^i}{d t} \frac{d x^j}{d t} = 0, \quad \text{for } k=1, \dots, m$$Here, $\frac{d x^i}{d t}$ are the components of the tangent vector $\dot{\gamma}(t)$, and $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the **Christoffel symbols of the second kind** (or **connection coefficients**) for the metric $g$, defined by: $$\Gamma^k_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} g^{k l} \left( \frac{\partial g_{l i}}{\partial x^j} + \frac{\partial g_{l j}}{\partial x^i} - \frac{\partial g_{i j}}{\partial x^l} \right)$$where $g^{kl}$ are the components of the inverse matrix of $[g_{ij}]$.
	- **Critical point of the length functional**: similar to that in [[Minimal Surface]], we can show that the geodesic equation is equivalent to the criticality condition of the length functional. 
## Example: scaled Euclidean metric on $S^2$
Take $M=S^2\subset\mathbb R^3$ and define a scaled inner product ([[Inner Product Space]])$$g_p(X_p,Y_p)=e^z\braket{X_p,Y_p},\quad\forall p=(x,y,z)\in M,X_p,Y_p\in T_pM$$where $\braket{\cdot,\cdot}$ is the usual inner product on [[Euclidean Space]]. It's quite trivial that $g_p$ defined above is a Riemannian metric, and below we go over some of its basic properties for illustration. 
- **Metric matrix**: take the spherical coordinate ([[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) $$p(\phi,\theta)=(\sin\phi\cos\theta,\sin\phi\sin\theta,\cos\phi)$$the the tangent vectors are given by $$\begin{align}\frac{\partial p}{\partial \phi} &= (\cos\phi \cos\theta, \cos\phi \sin\theta, -\sin\phi)\\\frac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}& = (-\sin\phi \sin\theta, \sin\phi \cos\theta, 0)\end{align}$$and therefore we can calculate the metric matrix as $$G_p=\begin{pmatrix}e^{\cos\phi}&0\\0&e^{\cos\phi}\sin^2\phi\end{pmatrix}$$
- **Curve length**: given a smooth [[Curve]] $\gamma:I\to M$ we have, by definition, $$\|\gamma'(t)\|_g=\sqrt{g(\gamma'(\gamma),\gamma'(t))}=e^{z(t)/2}\|\gamma'(t)\|$$Therefore the length of the curve is given by $$L(\gamma)=\int_I\|\gamma'(t)\|_gdt=\int_Ie^{z(t)/2}\|\gamma'(t)\|dt$$That is, the length under the new metric $g$ is a weighted integral by the factor $e^{z(t)/2}$.
- **Volume form**: by definition above we have $$\mu_g=e^{\cos\phi}\sin\phi d\phi\wedge d\theta$$This provides a direct illustration of how the scaling factor $e^z=e^{\cos\phi}$ affects the area measure - the area element at $(\phi,\theta)$ is $e^{\cos\phi}$ times the standard area element on the $S^2$ (as calculated in [[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]]). 
- **Geodesics**: we can verify that the meridians ($\theta=\text{const}$) are geodesics, while the equators ($\phi=\frac{\pi}{2}$) is not.
