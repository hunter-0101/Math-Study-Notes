A **differentiable (smooth) curve** in $\mathbb R^n$ ([[Euclidean Space]]) is a map $$\gamma\in C^k(I,\mathbb R),\quad k\ge1$$where $I\subset\mathbb R$ is an open interval, as defined in [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]. The curve is said to be **regular of order $k$** if $$\Set{\gamma^{(i)}(t):1\le i\le k}\text{ is a linearly independent set},\quad\forall t\in I$$Here the map $\gamma$ is also called a **parametrization** of the curve, and $\im\gamma$ is the **trace** of it. 
- **Arc length**: the arc length of $\gamma$ is given by $$L(\gamma)=\int_I\|\gamma'(t)\|dt=\int_I\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{d\gamma_i}{dt}\right)^2}dt$$Assuming $I=(t_0,t_1)$, then we can also define the **arc length function** $$s(t)=\int_{t_0}^t\|\gamma'(\tau)\|d\tau$$which measures the length of $\gamma((t_0,t))$.
	- Through this we can proof that the straight line is the shortest (use the inequality $\|\alpha'\|_2\ge\alpha'\cdot v$ for any unit vector $v$).
- **Natural parametrization**: any $\gamma$ admits a natural parametrization defined by $$\tilde\gamma(s)=\gamma\circ t(s)\quad\st\quad\|\tilde\gamma(s)\|=\left\|\frac{d\tilde\gamma}{ds}\right\|=1,\quad\forall s$$here $t(s)$ is the inverse function of $s(t)$, which exists by the inverse function theorem ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]). 
- **Re-parametrization**: a re-parametrization of $\gamma$ is any parametrization induced by $$\hat\gamma:\hat I\to\mathbb R^n,\quad\hat\gamma=\gamma\circ h(\hat t)\where h:\hat I\to I$$where $h$ is smooth and invertible. Obviously the trace is preserved under re-parametrization, and only the speed of traversal changes. 
	- **Equivalence**: regular curves $\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ are **equivalent** if one is a re-parametrization of the other. This is obviously an equivalence relation ([[Set Theory]]). 
## Generalized Frenet-Serret frame
Consider a regular curve $\gamma:I\to\mathbb R^n$ that is **naturally parametrized** in $s\in I$. We assume that $\gamma$ is regular of order $n$, and define its **canonical matrix** $$\Gamma(s)=\begin{pmatrix}\gamma^{(1)}(s)&\cdots&\gamma^{(n)}(s)\end{pmatrix}$$are linearly independent ([[Vector Space]]), then the **generalized tangent/normal vectors** of $\gamma$ at $\gamma(s)$ are calculated via the Gram-Schmidt process ([[Basis in Hilbert Space]]): $$E(s)=(e_i(s))_{1\le i\le n}=\text{GS}\left(\Gamma(s)\right)=\Gamma(s)$$The coordinate frame specified by $E(s)$ is called the **generalized Frenet-Serret frame** of $\gamma$ at $\gamma(s)$. Based on this we further define the **generalized curvature** as $$\kappa_i(s)=\braket{e_i'(s),e_{i+1}(s)},\quad1\le i\le n-1$$Note that conventionally we'll call $e_1,e_2,e_3,\cdots$ as the principal normal, binormal, trinomial, etc. 
- **Intuition**: there are several objects involved here, each of which deserves their own section of discussion on their geometric intuition:
	- **Frenet-Serret frame $E(s)$**: this is the canonical frame we can attach to the curve $\gamma$ at $\gamma(s)$, serving as a local coordinate that is essentially the same as the standard Euclidean coordinate. 
	- **Osculating $k$-plane**: the osculating $k$-plane is the plane defined as $$\Pi_k=\span(e_i:1\le i\le k),\quad1\le k\le n$$It's the best $k$-dimensional local linear approximation of $\gamma$, depicting its local behaviors.
	- **Generalized curvatures**: defined via $\kappa_i(s)=\braket{e_i'(s),e_{i+1}(s)}$, it measures the rate of change of $e_i(s)$ in the direction of $e_{i+1}(s)$. By G-S construction of the frame, $\kappa_k(s)$ also measures the **rate of the curve deviating from $\Pi_k$**.
- **Frenet-Serret formula**: in [[Matrix]] form the formula is given by $$\frac{d}{dx}E(s)=E(s)\Omega(s)\where\Omega(s)=\begin{bmatrix}0&-\kappa_1(s)&0&0\\\kappa_1(s)&\ddots&\ddots&0\\0&\ddots&\ddots&-\kappa_{n-1}(s)\\0&0&\kappa_{n-1}(s)&0\end{bmatrix}$$**Proof**: notice that the original vectors $(\gamma^{(i)}(s))_{1\le i\le n}$ are related by sequential differentiation. Firstly, by natural parametrization we have $$\|\gamma^{(1)}(s)\|=1\quad\implies\quad \begin{cases}e_1(s)=\gamma^{(1)}(s)\\ \gamma^{(2)}(s)\perp \gamma^{(1)}(s)\end{cases}\quad\implies\quad e_2(s)=\frac{\gamma^{(2)}(s)}{\|\gamma^{(2)}(s)\|}$$by differentiating both sides of the first equation in the middle we get $$e_1'(s)=\gamma^{(2)}(s)=\|\gamma^{(2)}(s)\|e_2(s)\imply\kappa_1=\|\gamma^{(2)}(s)\|=\frac{e_1'(s)}{e_2(s)}$$We proceed by induction on $k$. Assume that we've defined $(e_1,\cdots,e_k)$ and $(\kappa_1,\cdots,\kappa_{k-1})$ with the desired inequality holding for $1\le i\le k$. Since $\|e_k\|\equiv1$ we have $\braket{e_k',e_k}=0$, and by G-S process we know that $e_k$ is constructed from $\gamma^{(i)},1\le i\le k$, therefore $$e_k'=\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\braket{e_k',e_j}e_j+\braket{e_k',e_{k+1}}e_{k+1}$$By orthogonality, for any pair $j\neq k$ we have $$\braket{e_j,e_k}=0\imply\braket{e_j',e_k}+\braket{e_j,e_k'}=0\imply\braket{e_j,e_k'}=-\braket{e_j',e_k}$$Since $\text{RHS}=0,\forall j<k-1$ by induction assumption, the above summation reduces to $$e_k'=-\kappa_{k-1}e_{k-1}+\kappa_ke_{k+1}$$which is exactly the equality to prove, completing the induction. 
	- **Skew-symmetry**: we have $\Omega=-\Omega^T$, which is supposed to be expected, since by $E$ being a orthonormal basis we have $$EE^T=I\imply E'E^T+EE'^T=0\imply E(\Omega+\Omega^T)E^T=0\imply\Omega+\Omega^T=0$$where we used the differentiation formula in [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]. 
- **Diagonal entires of transformation matrix**: as discussed in [[Basis in Hilbert Space]] we have $$\Gamma(s)=E(s)R(s)\where R(s)=\begin{pmatrix}\Braket{e_i(s),\gamma^{(j)}(s)}\end{pmatrix}_{1\le i\le j\le n}$$Here $R$ is an upper triangular matrix with $R_{11}=1$. For other diagonal entires we have $$R_{kk}=\prod_{i=1}^{k-1}\kappa_i,\quad\forall2\le k\le n-1$$**Proof**: $R_{11}=1$ is trivial, and we proceed by induction from $k=2$. By natural parametrization we know that $\gamma^{(2)}\perp\gamma^{(1)}$ (as detailed below), hence $\gamma^{(2)}=\kappa_2e_2$, i.e., $R_{22}=\kappa_1$. Assuming that the equality holds for $2,\cdots,k$, then by definition we have $$\begin{align}R_{k+1,k+1}&=\Braket{\gamma^{(k+1)},e_{k+1}}=\Braket{\frac{d}{ds}\gamma^{(k)},e_{k+1}}\\&=\Braket{\frac{d}{ds}\sum_{i=1}^kR_{ii}e_i,e_{k+1}}\\&=\sum_{i=1}^k\Braket{R_{ii}' e_i,e_{k+1}}+\sum_{i=1}^k\Braket{R_{ii}e_i',e_{k+1}}\\&=R_{kk}\Braket{e_k',e_{k+1}}\\&=R_{kk}\kappa_k\end{align}$$Therefore the desired identity also hold for $k+1$, completing the induction. 
	- **Sign of generalized curvatures**: by property of G-S process we have $$R_{kk}>0,\quad\forall 1\le k\le n-1\imply\kappa_k>0,\quad\forall 1\le k\le n-2$$For the last curvature, notice that $$\Gamma=ER\imply\det \Gamma=\det R=\prod_{k=1}^NR_{kk}\imply\sgn\kappa_{n-1}=\sgn\det\Gamma$$As it turns out, the sign of $\kappa_{n-1}$ depends on $\Gamma$ itself, and can be positive or negative. Moreover, as can further deduce that $\kappa_{n-1}=0$ iff $\Gamma$ is linearly dependent. 
	- **Efficient computation of generalized curvature**: for a generally parametrized curve $\gamma(t)$, consider the matrix $M=\Gamma^T\Gamma$, and denote $M_i$ its leading principal minors, then $$\kappa_1=\frac{\sqrt{\det M_2}}{\|\gamma'\|^3},\quad\kappa_{n-1}=\frac{\det\Gamma\sqrt{\det M_{n-2}}}{\|\gamma'\|\det M_{n-1}}$$and other generalized curvatures are given by $$\kappa_i=\frac{\sqrt{\det M_{i-1}\det M_{i+1}}}{\|\gamma'\|\det M_i}$$This result is proved in the paper [*Generalized Curvatures of Cruves in R^n*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09782v1) on arXiv.
## Fundamental theorem of curves
**Fundamental theorem of curves**: given $I\subset\mathbb R$ an open interval and a collection of functions $\kappa_i\in C(I),1\le i\le n-1$ satisfying the positivity condition $$\kappa_i(s)>0,\quad\forall\in I,1\le i\le n-2$$then there exists a naturally parametrized, non-degenerate curve $\gamma:I\to\mathbb R^n$ that takes $\kappa_i$ as its generalized curvature, and this curve is unique up to congruence of rigid motion ([[Group Gallery]]).
**Proof**: for existence, we'd like to solve the ODEs given by $$\frac{d}{ds}E(s)=E(s)\Omega(s),\quad E(s_0)=I$$where $E(s)=(e_1(s),\cdots,e_n(s))^T$ is the Frenet-Serret frame of $\gamma$ and $\Omega$ is the curvature matrix given above. By [[Linear ODE System]] the above system admits a solution $E(s)$, which satisfies $$\frac{d}{ds}(EE^T)=E'E^T+EE'^T=E(\Omega+\Omega^T)E^T=0\imply EE^T\equiv I$$hence $E$ is always an orthonormal frame, which allows us to construct $\gamma$ as $$\gamma(s)=\int_{s_0}^se_1(\tau)d\tau+\gamma_0\where \gamma_0=\gamma(s_0)\in\mathbb R^n$$By [[Differentiation Under the Integral Sign]] we can verify that $\gamma(s)$ is naturally parametrized. For uniqueness up to congruence, take two curves $\gamma,\tilde\gamma$ with Frenet-Serret frames $E,\tilde E$ satisfying the equations above, then since both frames are orthonormal, we have $E,\tilde E\in O_n$ ([[Group Gallery]]), which means we can take the initial rotation and translation $$\tilde E(s_0)=RE(s_0),\quad\tilde\gamma(s_0)=R\gamma(s_0)+T\where R\in O_n,T\in T_n$$Define a new frame $\overline E(s)=RE(s)$, then by simple arithmetic property of [[Matrix]] we have $$\frac{d}{ds}\overline E(s)=\frac{d}{ds}(RE(s))=R\frac{d}{ds}E(s)=RE(s)\Omega(s)=\overline E(s)\Omega(s)$$this equation, combined with the initial condition, yields the IVP $\overline E(s)$ satisfies: $$\frac{d}{dx}\overline E(s)=\overline E(s)\Omega(s),\quad\overline E(s_0)=E(s_0)R$$This is identical to the one $\tilde E(s)$ satisfies, hence by the uniqueness theorem we conclude that $$\tilde E(s)=\overline E(s)=RE(s),\quad\forall s\in I$$This, combined with the initial condition $\tilde\gamma(s_0)=R\gamma(s_0)+T$, implies that $$\tilde\gamma(s)=R\gamma(s)+T,\quad\forall s\in I$$which is exactly the congruence of rigid motion we expect. 
- **Characterization of a straight line**: a naturally parametrized curve $\gamma(s)$ is a straight line if and only if **all its generalized curvatures are identically zero**, i.e. $$\kappa_i(s)=0,\quad\forall s\in I,q\le i\le n-1$$This is a direct corollary of the fundamental theorem, and is useful for verification of line. 
### Curves in $\mathbb R^3$
All the above discussion reduces to some widely applicable results for curves in $\mathbb R^3$.
- **Reduced Frenet-Serret frame**: conventionally we denote $$\mathbf T(s)=e_1(s),\quad\mathbf N(s)=e_2(s),\quad\mathbf B(s)=e_3(s)$$which are called the **tangent**, **normal**, and **binormal** vector. 
- **Reduced curvature**: conventionally we call $$\kappa=\kappa_1,\quad\tau=\kappa_2$$ the **curvature** and **torsion**, measuring the rate of twisting of the curve itself and the osculating plane respectively. 
- **Reduced Frenet-Serret formulas**: we have the reduced form $$\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{T}' \\ \mathbf{N}' \\ \mathbf{B}' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \kappa & 0 \\ -\kappa & 0 & \tau \\ 0 & -\tau & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{T} \\ \mathbf{N} \\ \mathbf{B} \end{pmatrix}$$which is commonly used in many scenarios. 
There are some useful formulas:
- **Curvature & torsion**: we have $$\kappa(t) = \frac{\Vert \gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t) \Vert}{\Vert \gamma'(t) \Vert^3},\quad\tau(t) = \frac{(\gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t)) \cdot \gamma'''(t)}{\Vert \gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t) \Vert^2}, \quad \text{if } \kappa(t) \ne 0$$The numerator $(\gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t)) \cdot \gamma'''(t)$ is the scalar triple product of the first three derivatives.
- **Tangent**: $\mathbf{T}(t) = \frac{\gamma'(t)}{\Vert \gamma'(t) \Vert}$.
- **Binormal**: $\mathbf{B}(t) = \frac{\gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t)}{\Vert \gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t) \Vert}$.
- **Normal**: $\mathbf{N}(t) = \mathbf{B}(t) \times \mathbf{T}(t)$. 
### Example: Helix
Consider the helix given by $$\gamma(t)=(r\cos t,r\sin t,vt),\quad t\in\mathbb R$$given parameters $r,v>0$. We go over the calculation of its basic properties. 
- **Natural parametrization**: the velocity vector under the parametrization of $t$ is $$\gamma'(t) = \frac{d\gamma}{dt} = \left( \frac{d}{dt}(r\cos t), \frac{d}{dt}(r\sin t), \frac{d}{dt}(vt) \right) = (-r\sin t, r\cos t, v)$$Hence the velocity is $$\|\gamma'(t)\|=\sqrt{r^2+v^2}$$Therefore the natural parametrization is given by $$\gamma(s) = \left( r\cos\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{r^2+v^2}}\right), r\sin\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{r^2+v^2}}\right), \frac{v}{\sqrt{r^2+v^2}}s \right)$$For simplicity we'll denote $c=\sqrt{r^2+v^2}$.
- **Frenet-Serret frame**: the first three derivatives are given by $$\begin{align}\gamma'(s) &= \left( -\frac{r}{c}\sin\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), \frac{r}{c}\cos\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), \frac{v}{c} \right)\\\gamma''(s)&= \left( -\frac{r}{c^2}\cos\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), -\frac{r}{c^2}\sin\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), 0 \right)\\\gamma'''(s)& =  \left( \frac{r}{c^3}\sin\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), -\frac{r}{c^3}\cos\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), 0 \right)\end{align}$$And after applying the G-S process we get $$\begin{align}e_1(s)& = \left( -\frac{r}{c}\sin\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), \frac{r}{c}\cos\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), \frac{v}{c} \right)\\e_2(s) &=\left( -\cos\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), -\sin\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), 0 \right)\\e_3(s)& = \left( \frac{v}{c}\sin\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), -\frac{v}{c}\cos\left(\frac{s}{c}\right), \frac{r}{c} \right)\end{align}$$which made up the Frenet-Serret frame. 
- **Curvature & torsion**: by definition, we have $$\kappa_1 = \kappa = \frac{r}{r^2 + v^2},\quad\kappa_2=\tau=\frac{v}{r^2+v^2}$$
