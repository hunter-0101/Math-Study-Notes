A **differentiable (smooth) curve** in $\mathbb R^n$ ([[Euclidean Space]]) is a map $$\gamma\in C^k(I,\mathbb R),\quad k\ge1$$where $I\subset\mathbb R$ is an open interval, as defined in [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]. The curve is said to be **regular** if $$\gamma'(t)=\frac{d\gamma}{dt}\neq0,\quad\forall t\in I$$Here the map $\gamma$ is also called a **parametrization** of the curve, and $\im\gamma$ is the **trace** of it. 
- **Arc length**: the arc length of $\gamma$ is given by $$L(\gamma)=\int_I\|\gamma'(t)\|dt=\int_I\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{d\gamma_i}{dt}\right)^2}dt$$Assuming $I=(t_0,t_1)$, then we can also define the **arc length function** $$s(t)=\int_{t_0}^t\|\gamma'(\tau)\|d\tau$$which measures the length of $\gamma((t_0,t))$.
	- Through this we can proof that the straight line is the shortest (use the inequality $\|\alpha'\|_2\ge\alpha'\cdot v$ for any unit vector $v$).
- **Natural parametrization**: any $\gamma$ admits a natural parametrization defined by $$\tilde\gamma(s)=\gamma\circ t(s)\quad\st\quad\|\tilde\gamma(s)\|=\left\|\frac{d\tilde\gamma}{ds}\right\|=1,\quad\forall s$$here $t(s)$ is the inverse function of $s(t)$, which exists by the inverse function theorem ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]). 
- **Re-parametrization**: a re-parametrization of $\gamma$ is any parametrization induced by $$\hat\gamma:\hat I\to\mathbb R^n,\quad\hat\gamma=\gamma\circ h(\hat t)\where h:\hat I\to I$$where $h$ is smooth and invertible. Obviously the trace is preserved under re-parametrization, and only the speed of traversal changes. 
	- **Equivalence**: regular curves $\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ are **equivalent** if one is a re-parametrization of the other. This is obviously an equivalence relation ([[Set Theory]]). 
## Generalized Frenet-Serret frame
Consider a regular curve $\gamma:I\to\mathbb R^n$ that is naturally parametrized in $s\in I$. We assume that $\gamma$ is **non-degenerated of order $n$**, i.e., the set of vectors $$\Gamma=\Set{\gamma^{(i)}(s)}_{1\le i\le n}$$ are linearly independent ([[Vector Space]]), then the **generalized tangent vectors** of $\gamma$ at $\gamma(s)$ are calculated via the Gram-Schmidt process ([[Basis in Hilbert Space]]): $$(e_i(s))_{1\le i\le n}=\text{GS}\left(\gamma^{(i)}(s):1\le i\le n\right)$$The coordinate frame defined by $\set{e_i(s)}_{1\le i\le n}$ is called the **generalized Frenet-Serret frame** of $\gamma$ at $\gamma(s)$. Based on this we further define the **generalized curvature** as $$\chi_i(s)=\braket{e_i'(s),e_{i+1}(s)},\quad1\le i\le n-1$$Note that conventionally we'll call $e_1,e_2,e_3,\cdots$ as the principal normal, binormal, trinomial, etc. 
- **Intuition**: the Frenet-Serret frame $(e_i(s))_{i=1}^n$ is the canonical frame we can attach to the curve $\gamma$ at $\gamma(s)$, and its generalized curvatures $\chi_i(s)=\braket{e_i'(s),e_{i+1}(s)}$, measures the rate of change of $e_i(s)$ in the direction of $e_{i+1}(s)$. By construction of the frame, it also measures the rate the curve itself deviates from its osculating $k$-plane. 
	- **Osculating $k$-plane**: this refers to the subspace specified as $\span(e_i:1\le i\le k)$, which locally approximates the curve.
- **Frenet-Serret formula**: in [[Matrix]] form the formula is given by $$\begin{bmatrix}e_1'(s)\\e_2'(s)\\\vdots\\e_n'(s)\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0&\chi_1(s)&0&0\\-\chi_1(s)&\ddots&\ddots&0\\0&\ddots&\ddots&\chi_{n-1}(s)\\0&0&-\chi_{n-1}(s)&0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}e_1(s)\\e_2(s)\\\vdots\\e_n(s)\end{bmatrix}$$**Proof**: notice that the original vectors $(\gamma^{(i)}(s))_{1\le i\le n}$ are related by sequential differentiation. Firstly, by natural parametrization we have $$\|\gamma^{(1)}(s)\|=1\quad\implies\quad \begin{cases}e_1(s)=\gamma^{(1)}(s)\\ \gamma^{(2)}(s)\perp \gamma^{(1)}(s)\end{cases}\quad\implies\quad e_2(s)=\frac{\gamma^{(2)}(x)}{\|\gamma^{(2)}(x)\|}$$by differentiating both sides of the first equation in the middle we get $$e_1'(s)=\gamma^{(2)}(s)=\|\gamma^{(2)}(s)\|e_2(s)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\chi_1=\|\gamma^{(2)}(s)\|=\frac{e_1'(s)}{e_2(s)}$$We proceed by induction on $k$. Having defined $(e_1,\cdots,e_k)$ and $(\chi_1,\cdots,\chi_{k-1})$ with the desired inequality holding for $1\le i\le k$, we have $$\|e_k\|\equiv1\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\braket{e_k',e_k}=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad e_k'=\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\braket{e_k',e_j}e_j+\braket{e_k',e_{k+1}}e_{k+1}$$where $e_{k+1}$ is the new direction, due to sequential differentiation structure. By orthogonality, $$\braket{e_j,e_k}=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\braket{e_j',e_k}+\braket{e_j,e_k'}=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\braket{e_j,e_k'}=-\braket{e_j',e_k}$$Since for $j<k-1$ we have $\text{RHS}=0$ by assumption, the above summation reduces to $$e_k'=-\chi_{k-1}e_{k-1}+\chi_ke_{k+1}$$which is exactly the equality to prove. Hence induction completes the proof. 
	- **Skew-symmetry**: denoting the above identity as $$\frac{d}{dx}E(s)=\Omega(s) E(s)$$then we have that $\Omega$ being skew-symmetric, meaning that $\Omega=-\Omega^T$. This is expected, since by $E$ being a orthonormal basis we have $$E^TE=I\quad\Longrightarrow\quad E'^TE+E^TE'=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad E^T(\Omega+\Omega^T)E=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\Omega+\Omega^T=0$$where we used the differentiation formula in [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]. 
- **Positivity of curvature**: we have $$\chi_k(s) = \left\|P_k(\gamma^{(k+1)}(s))\right\| > 0, \quad \forall1\le k\le n-1$$where $P_k$ is the projection onto $\span(e_i:1\le i\le k)$. Therefore $\chi_k$ are invariant under orientation-preserving re-parametrization.
## Fundamental theorem of curves
**Fundamental theorem of curves**: given $I\subset\mathbb R$ an open interval and a collection of functions $\chi_i\in C(I),1\le i\le n-1$ satisfying the positivity condition $$\chi_i(s)>0,\quad\forall\in I,1\le i\le n-2$$then there exists a naturally parametrized, non-degenerate curve $\gamma:I\to\mathbb R^n$ that takes $\chi_i$ as its generalized curvature, and this curve is unique up to congruence of rigid motion ([[Group Gallery]]).
**Proof**: for existence, we'd like to solve the ODEs given by $$\frac{d}{ds}E(s)=\Omega(s)E(s),\quad E(s_0)=I$$where $E(s)=(e_1(s),\cdots,e_n(s))^T$ is the Frenet-Serret frame of $\gamma$ and $\Omega$ is the curvature matrix given above. By [[Linear ODE System]] the above system admits a solution $E(s)$, which satisfies $$\frac{d}{ds}(E^TE)=E'^TE+E^TE'=E^T(\Omega^T+\Omega)E=0\imply E^TE\equiv I$$hence $E$ is always a orthonormal frame, which allows us to construct $\gamma$ as $$\gamma(s)=\int_{s_0}^se_q(\tau)d\tau+\gamma_0\where \gamma_0=\gamma(s_0)\in\mathbb R^n$$By [[Differentiation Under the Integral Sign]] we can verify that $\gamma(s)$ is naturally parametrized. For uniqueness up to congruence, take two curves $\gamma,\tilde\gamma$ with Frenet-Serret frames $E,\tilde E$ satisfying the equations above, then since both frames are orthonormal, we have $E,\tilde E\in O_n$ ([[Group Gallery]]), which means we can take the initial rotation and translation $$\tilde E(s_0)=E(s_0)R,\quad\tilde\gamma(s_0)=R\gamma(s_0)+T\where R\in O_n,T\in T_n$$Define a new frame $\overline E(s)=RE(s)$, then by simple arithmetic property of [[Matrix]] we have $$\frac{d}{ds}\overline E(s)=\frac{d}{ds}(E(s)R)=\frac{d}{ds}E(s)R=\Omega(s)E(s)R=\Omega(s)\overline E(s)$$this equation, combined with the initial condition, yields the IVP $\overline E(s)$ satisfies: $$\frac{d}{dx}\overline E(s)=\Omega(s)\overline E(s),\quad\overline E(s_0)=E(s_0)R$$This is identical to the one $\tilde E(s)$ satisfies, hence by the uniqueness theorem we conclude that $$\tilde E(s)=\overline E(s)=E(s)R,\quad\forall s\in I$$This, combined with the initial condition $\tilde\gamma(s_0)=R\gamma(s_0)+T$, implies that $$\tilde\gamma(s)=R\gamma(s)+T,\quad\forall s\in I$$which is exactly the congruence of rigid motion we expect. 
- **Characterization of a straight line**: a naturally parametrized curve $\gamma(s)$ is a straight line if and only if **all its generalized curvatures are identically zero**, i.e. $$\chi_i(s)=0,\quad\forall s\in I,q\le i\le n-1$$This is a direct corollary of the fundamental theorem, and is useful for verification of line. 
### Curves in $\mathbb R^3$
All the above discussion reduces to some widely applicable results for curves in $\mathbb R^3$.
- **Reduced Frenet-Serret frame**: conventionally we denote $$\mathbf T(s)=e_1(s),\quad\mathbf N(s)=e_2(s),\quad\mathbf B(s)=e_3(s)$$which are called the **tangent**, **normal**, and **binormal** vector. 
- **Reduced curvature**: conventionally we call $$\kappa=\chi_1,\quad\tau=\chi_2$$ the **curvature** and **torsion**, measuring the rate of twisting of the curve itself and the osculating plane respectively. 
- **Reduced Frenet-Serret formulas**: we have the reduced form $$\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{T}' \\ \mathbf{N}' \\ \mathbf{B}' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \kappa & 0 \\ -\kappa & 0 & \tau \\ 0 & -\tau & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{T} \\ \mathbf{N} \\ \mathbf{B} \end{pmatrix}$$which is commonly used in many scenarios. 
There are some useful formulas:
- **Curvature**: $$\kappa(t) = \frac{\Vert \gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t) \Vert}{\Vert \gamma'(t) \Vert^3}$$
- **Torsion**: $$\tau(t) = \frac{(\gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t)) \cdot \gamma'''(t)}{\Vert \gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t) \Vert^2}, \quad \text{if } \kappa(t) \ne 0$$The numerator $(\gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t)) \cdot \gamma'''(t)$ is the scalar triple product of the first three derivatives.
- **Tangent**: $\mathbf{T}(t) = \frac{\gamma'(t)}{\Vert \gamma'(t) \Vert}$.
- **Binormal**: $\mathbf{B}(t) = \frac{\gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t)}{\Vert \gamma'(t) \times \gamma''(t) \Vert}$.
- **Normal**: $\mathbf{N}(t) = \mathbf{B}(t) \times \mathbf{T}(t)$. 
- **Fundamental theorem of curves**: every regular curve in $\mathbb R^3$ with non-zero curvature has its shape and size completely determined by its curvature and torsion.
