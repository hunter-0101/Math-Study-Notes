**Comparison theorems** assert particular properties of solutions of a differential equation (or of a system thereof), provided that an auxiliary equation/inequality (or a system thereof) possesses a certain property. 
## Chaplygin's theorem
The Chaplygin's theorem states about existence and uniqueness of the solution to an IVP for the [[First Order ODE]].
- **Upper (Lower) boundary solution**: denoted $\overline{z}(t),\underline{z}(t)$ respectively, they're smooth in $(t_0,a]$ and continuous in $[t_0,a]$, such as the following inequalities are true:$$\begin{align}&\underline{z}(t_0)<y(t_0)<\overline{z}(t_0)\\&\underline{z}'(t)<f(t,\underline{z}(t))\text{ and }\overline{z}'(t)>f(t,\overline{z}(t)),\quad\forall t\in(t_0,a]\end{align}$$
- **Chaplygin's theorem**: given the above condition and definitions, if the $f(t,y(t))$
	1. is continuous in $t\in[t_0,a],y(t)\in[\underline{z}(t),\overline{z}(t)]$
	2. satisfies the Lipschitz condition over variable $y$ between functions $\overline{z}(t),\underline{z}(t)$
	then in $t\in[t_0,a]$ there exists a unique solution $y(t)$ for the given IVP and moreover for all $t$, we have $\underline{z}(t)<y(t)<\overline{z}(t)$.
## Grönwall's inequality
Below we provide two different forms of the **Grönwall's inequality**. We'll denote $I\subset\mathbb R$ an interval, and assume that $\beta,u$ are continuous.
- **Differential form**: if $u$ is differentiable in $I^\circ$ and satisfies $$u'(t)\le\beta(t)u(t),\quad\forall t\in I^\circ$$then $u$ is bounded by the solution of the corresponding ODE $v'=\beta v$, that is, $$u(t)\le u(a)\exp\left(\int_a^t\beta(s)ds\right)$$**Proof**: by [[First Order ODE]] the solution to $v'=\beta v$ is given by $$v(t)=\exp\left(\int_a^t\beta(s)ds\right)$$Now notice that using the quotient rule ([[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) we have $$\frac{d}{dt}\frac{u(t)}{v(t)}=\frac{u'v-v'u}{v^2}=\frac{u'v-\beta vu}{v^2}\le0$$thus $u(t)/v(t)\le u(a)$, which is exactly the Grönwall's inequality.
	- **Generalization to inhomogeneous case**: a simple generalization is the assumption $$G'(\tau)\le CG(\tau)+F(\tau)$$where $G(0)=0$ and $F$ non-decreasing. In such case we have $$G'(\tau)\le e^{C\tau}F(\tau),\quad G(\tau)\le C^{-1}(e^{C\tau}-1)F(\tau)$$and which can be show via exactly the same method as above.
- **Integral form**: if $\beta$ is non-negative and $u$ satisfies $$u(t)\le\alpha(t)+\int_a^t\beta(s)u(s)ds,\quad\forall t\in I$$then we have $$u(t)\le\alpha(t)+\int_a^t\alpha(s)\beta(s)\exp\left(\int_s^t\beta(r)dr\right)dx,\quad\forall t\in I$$if in addition, the function $\alpha$ is non-decreasing, then $$u(t)\le\alpha(t)\exp\left(\int_a^t\beta(s)ds\right),\quad\forall t\in I$$**Proof**: define the function $$v(s)=\exp\left(-\int_a^s\beta(r)dr\right)\int_a^s\beta(r)u(r)dr,\quad\forall s\in I$$the by the product and chain rule we have $$v'(s)=\left(u(s)-\int_a^s\beta(r)u(r)dr\right)\beta(s)\exp\left(-\int_a^s\beta(r)dr\right)\le\alpha(s)\beta(s)\exp\left(-\int_a^s\beta(r)dr\right)$$also notice that $v(0)=0$, hence by direct integration we get $$v(t)\le\int_a^t\alpha(s)\beta(s)\exp\left(-\int_a^s\beta(r)dr\right)ds$$by definition of $v$ we get $$\int_a^t\beta(s)u(s)ds=\exp\left(\int_a^t\beta(r)dr\right)v(t)\le\int_a^t\alpha(s)\beta(s)\exp\left(\int_a^t\beta(r)dr-\int_a^s\beta(r)dr\right)ds$$now we can substitute the result directly into the assumption to get the first inequality. Some simple calculation using the fundamental theorem of calculus ([[Integral Calculus on Euclidean Space]]) yields the second.
- **Applications**: Grönwall’s inequality is crucial for establishing **uniqueness** in solutions to IVPs for ODEs and is used in the **proof of the Picard-Lindelöf theorem** for uniqueness. It also helps in deriving bounds on solutions, ensuring that if the function $u(t)$ is initially small, it cannot grow too fast. [[First Order ODE]]
## Sturm comparison theorem
The Sturm comparison theorem allows comparison of the zeros of two solutions to second-order linear differential equations.
- **Sturm comparison theorem**: Consider two second-order linear differential equations of the form
$$ y'' + p(t)y = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad z'' + q(t)z = 0, $$
where $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are continuous functions on the interval $(a, b)$. Assume that $p(t) \leq q(t)$ on $(a, b)$. Let $y(t)$ and $z(t)$ be solutions to these equations with simple zeros. Then, if $y(t)$ has two consecutive zeros at $t_1$ and $t_2$, there is at least one zero of $z(t)$ in the interval $(t_1, t_2)$.
- **Implications**: This theorem is valuable in studying the **oscillatory behavior** of solutions to differential equations. It gives a way to estimate the zeros of solutions to more complicated equations by comparing them with solutions of simpler or well-known equations.
## Hille-Wintner comparison theorem
The Hille-Wintner comparison theorem is an extension of the Sturm comparison theorem for more general second-order differential equations.
- **Hille-Wintner comparison theorem**: Let $y'' + p(t)y = 0$ and $z'' + q(t)z = 0$ be two second-order differential equations. Assume that $q(t) \geq p(t)$. If there exists a solution $y(t)$ of the first equation that has infinitely many zeros on $[a, \infty)$, then any solution $z(t)$ of the second equation also has infinitely many zeros on $[a, \infty)$.
- **Implications**: This theorem is useful for determining the **oscillatory nature** of solutions to differential equations and is often applied in the study of **Sturm-Liouville theory** and spectral analysis. It also generalizes the idea of comparing oscillations and zeros between solutions of different differential equations.
