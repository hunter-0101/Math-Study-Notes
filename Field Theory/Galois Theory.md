For a [[Field Extension]] $L/K$, a **$K$-automorphism of $L$** is any $\phi\in\aut L$ that fixes $K$. Define $$\gal(L/K)=\set{K\text{-automorphisms of }L}$$then $\gal(L/K)$ forms a [[Group]] under composition, called the **Galois group**.
- **Galois extension**: $L/K$ is said to be Galois if it's finite, normal, and separable.
	- **Discussion**: some authors requires a Galois extension to be algebraic, normal, and separable. This covers a wider range since any finite extension is algebraic ([[Field Extension]]).
- **Correspondence between subgroup and intermediate field**: obviously there is a bijective correspondence between $H<\gal(L/K)$ and $K\subset M\subset L$, given by:
	- **Galois group of intermediate field**: given any intermediate $M$ of $L/K$ denote $$G_M=\gal(L:M)$$Hence we have $G_K=\gal(L/K),G_L=\set{1}$.
	- **Fixed field of subgroup**: given any $H<\gal(L/K)$ we associate it with $$L^H=\set{x\in L:h(x)=x,\forall h\in H}$$This is obviously an intermediate field by property of automorphism ([[Group Actions]]).
## Fundamental theorem of Galois theory
If $L/K$ is a Galois, then $\left|\gal(L/K)\right|=[L:K]$, and there is a bijection between intermediate fields $M$ of $L/K$ and subgroups $H\le \gal(L/K)$ given by $$M\mapsto\gal(L/M)\quad\text{with the inverse given by}\quad H\mapsto L^H$$Moreover, $M/K$ is finite separable, with $$M/K\text{ is normal}\quad\iff\quad\gal(L/M)\triangleleft\gal(L/K)$$in which case we have an isomorphism ([[Group Homomorphism]]) $$\gal(M/K)\cong\frac{\gal(L/K)}{\gal(L/M)}$$We separate the proof of the above theorem into four steps:
1. **Galois group of intermediate field**: let $L/M$ be Galois, then $\left|\gal(L/M)\right|=[L:M]$ and $M$ is its fixed field.
   **Proof**: by primitive element theorem ([[Polynomial over a Field]]) $L=M(\alpha),\alpha\in L$, hence by [[Field Extension]] we have $[L:M]=\deg\mu_{\alpha/M}$, and the lemma below implies $\left|\gal(L/M)\right|=[L:M]$. If there exists $\beta\in L-M$ that is fixed by $\gal(L/M)$, we can pick $\beta'\neq\beta$ another root of $\mu_{\beta/M}$, and by the normality criterion ([[Field Extension]]) there exists $\phi:M(\beta)\to M(\beta')$ with $\phi(\beta)=\beta'$ that extends to $M$-automorphism $\sigma:L\to L$. Now $\sigma\in\gal(L/M)$ with $\sigma(\beta)=\beta'\neq\beta$, which is a contradiction. 
	- **Number of $K$-homomorphisms**: let $\alpha$ be algebraic over $K$ and $L/K$ an extension that contains the splitting field of $\mu_{\alpha/K}$, then the number of $K$-homomorphisms from $K(\alpha)$ to $L$ equals the number of distinct roots of $\mu_{\alpha/K}$. In particular, the number is $\le[K(\alpha):K]$ with equality holding iff all roots of $\mu_{\alpha/K}$ are distinct.
	  **Proof**: denote $\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_r$ all possible distinct roots of $\mu_{\alpha/K}$, then by isomorphic simple extensions ([[Polynomial over a Field]]) for any $1\le i\le r$ there exists isomorphism $$\psi_i:K(\alpha)\to K(\alpha_i)\quad\text{s.t.}\quad\psi|_K=\id_K,\quad\psi(\alpha)=\alpha_i$$Moreover, if $\eta:K(\alpha)\to L$ is any $K$-homomorphism, then $f^\eta=f$, hence $\eta(\alpha)=\alpha_i$ for some $i$, which implies $\eta=\psi_i$. The inequality is immediate.
2. **Fixed field of Galois group**: let $L/K$ be a field extension and $H\le\gal(L/K)$ be finite, then $L/L^H$ is Galois, and $\gal(L/L^H)=H$.
   **Proof**:
