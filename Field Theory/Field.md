A **field** is a tuple $(F,+,\cdot)$ s.t. 
- **Division ring (skew field) structure**: $(F,+,\cdot)$ is a division [[Ring]].
- **Commutativity**: $(F\backslash\set{0},\cdot)$ is an abelian [[Group]].
To put more succinctly, a field is a **commutative division ring**. It generalizes the [[Real Number System]], and serves as powerful tool for dealing with general algebraic structures. Below we list some basic facts about fields. 
- **Characteristic**: the characteristic of field $F$ is defined as its ring characteristic $$\char F=|1|_+$$Similarly, when such integer does not exist we say $\char F=0$.
- **Algebraical closedness**: $F$ is algebraically closed if every non-constant polynomial in $F[X]$ the [[Polynomial Ring]] has a root in $F$, i.e., the fundamental theorem of algebra holds. 
	- **Algebraic closure**: the algebraic closure of $F$ is defined as 
	- **Algebraically closed field is infinite**: $F$ algebraically closed must satisfy $|F|=\infty$, since under finiteness assumption we can construct polynomial violating closedness by $$F=\set{a_1,\cdots,a_n}\imply P(x)=1+\prod_{i=1}^n(x-a_i)\neq0,\quad\forall x\in F$$This follows from the fact that $1=0\iff F=\set{0}$. However it can be countably infinite, for instance, the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb Q}$.
- **Valuation**: given a field $F$ and an abelian totally ordered ([[Order]]) [[Group]] $(\Gamma,+,\ge)$ extended to $\Gamma\cup\set{\infty}$ with $\infty\ge a,a+\infty=\infty+a=\infty+\infty=\infty,\forall a\in F$, a **valuation** of $F$ is a map $$\nu:F\to \Gamma\cup\set{\infty}\quad\st\quad\begin{cases}\nu(a)=\infty\iff a=0\\\nu(ab)=\nu(a)+\nu(b)\\\nu(a+b)\ge\min(\nu(a),\nu(b)),\text{with equality if }\nu(a)\neq\nu(b)\end{cases}$$A valuation is called **trivial** if $\nu(a)=0,\forall a\in F^\times$, and **discrete** if $\Gamma=\mathbb Z$. 
- **CRT formula**: in a field the CRT in [[Ideal]] has an explicit formula $$f\equiv r_k\pmod{I_k}\quad\iff\quad f\equiv\sum_{k=1}^nr_kJ_k(J_k^{-1}\bmod I_k)\quad\text{where}\quad J_k=\prod_{s\neq k}I_s$$which generalizes the one in [[Congruence System]]. 
- **Absolute value**: over any field $F$ (or [[Integral Domain]]) an absolute value is a real-valued function satisfying:
	1. **Positive definiteness**: $|x|\ge0,\forall x\in F$ and $|x|=0\iff x=0$.
	2. **Multiplicity**: $|xy|=|x|\cdot|y|,\forall x,y\in F$.
	3. **Triangle inequality**: $|x+y|\le|x|+|y|,\forall x,y\in F$.
  The **trivial absolute value** is the one with $|x|=1,\forall x\neq0$.
- **Involution**: an involution over $F$ is a function $f:F\to F$ that is **involutary**, i.e., $$f\circ f(x)=x,\quad\forall x\in F$$Algebraically, it's a field automorphism or order $2$. An involution is usually denoted $x\mapsto\overline x$. 
	- **Fixed field of involution**: the fixed field of $F$ induced by $x\mapsto\overline x$ is , literally, defined as $F_0=\set{x\in F:x=\overline x}$ the subfield fixed under the involution. 
- **Ordered field**: an ordered field is a tuple $(F,\le)$ is totally ordered ([[Order]]). 
	- **Archimedean property**: $(F,\le)$ is Archimedean if every element lies between two elements f its rational subfield (field of fraction). 
## Field extension
A **field extension** is an inclusion map $\iota:K\to L$, denoted $L/K$. 
- **Degree**: viewing $L$ as a $K$-[[Vector Space]], then the degree of $L/K$ is defined as $$[L:K]=\dim_KL$$Given $K\subset M\subset L$ we have the **short tower law** $[L:K]=[L:M][M:K]$.
  **Proof**: take $B_{L/M}=\set{l_i},B_{M/K}=\set{m_j}$ the basis s.t. $$L=\span_M(B_{L/M}),\quad M=\span_K(B_{M/K})$$then obviously $B=B_{L/M}B_{M/K}$ forms a $K$-frame for $L$. For linear dependence notice that $$\sum_{i,j}k_{ij}l_jm_j=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sum_j\left(\sum_i k_{ij}l_j\right)m_i=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sum_ik_{ij}l_j=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad k_{ij}=0,\forall i,j$$hence $B$ is indeed a $K$-basis for $L$, completing the proof.
	- **Tower law**: by induction we can easily show that $[K_n:K_0]=\prod[K_{i+1}:K_i]$.
	- **Finite extension**: $L/K$ is finite if $[L:K]<\infty$. 
- **Algebraic & transcendental element**: given $L/K$, an element $\alpha\in L$ is said to be **algebraic** over $K$ if there exists $p\in K[x]$ s.t. $p(\alpha)=0$, and **transcendental** otherwise.
	- **Field of algebraic elements**: give $L/K$, it's obvious that the set $$M=\set{\ell\in L:\ell\text{ is algebraic over }K}$$is an intermediate field.
	  **Proof**: obviously $K\subset M\subset L$. Notice that for any $\alpha,\beta\in M$ we have $$[K(\alpha,\beta):K]=[K(\alpha,\beta):K(\alpha)][K(\alpha):K]<\infty$$by the simple algebraic extension result below, hence $K(\alpha,\beta)/K$ is algebraic, which means $\alpha\pm\beta,\alpha\beta,\alpha\beta^{-1}\in M$, hence $M$ is a field.
- **Algebraic extension**: $L/K$ is algebraic if all elements in $L$ are algebraic over $K$.
	- **Algebraic over algebraic is algebraic**: $L/M,M/K$ both algebraic implies $L/K$ algebraic.
	  **Proof**: for any $\alpha\in L$, since $L/M$ is algebraic there exist $b_i\in M$ s.t. $\sum_{i=0}^nb_i\alpha^i=0$, hence $$\begin{align}[K(\alpha):K]&\le[K(b_0,\cdots,b_n,\alpha):K]\\&=[K(b_0,\cdots,b_n,\alpha):K(b_0,\cdots,b_n)][K(b_0,\cdots,b_n):K]\\&<\infty\end{align}$$Where we used the tower law above and the finite extension criterion below, hence $\alpha$ is algebraic over $K$. By arbitrariness $L/K$ is algebraic.
	- **Infinite algebraic extension**: below we list some algebraic extensions that are infinite: 
		- **Roots of unity**: consider $$\mathbb Q(U)/\mathbb Q\quad\text{where}\quad U=\set{z\in\mathbb C:z^p=1,p\in\mathbb P}$$This is infinite because any set of $p$-th roots of unity contributes $p-1$ degrees, and is algebraic due to some simple identities.
		- **Square root of primes**: consider $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{\mathbb P})/\mathbb Q\quad\text{where}\quad\sqrt{\mathbb P}=\set{\sqrt p:p\in\mathbb P}$$This is infinite because elements in $\sqrt{\mathbb P}$ are $\mathbb Q$-linearly independent (we skip the proof).
### Field generated by a set
Since the set of intermediate fields is closed under intersection, given any set $S\subset L$ there exists a **unique** minimal intermediate field $K(S)$ s.t. $$S\subset K(S),\quad K\subset K(S)\subset L$$We call $K(S)$ the **field generated by $S$ over $K$**. $K(S)$ is **finitely generated** if $|S|<\infty$.
- **Alternative characterization**: we have the field of fraction characterization $$K(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s)=\Frac (K[\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s])$$where $K[\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s]$ is the multivariate [[Polynomial Ring]], since all elements in RHS can be obtained via algebraic calculation, while it's indeed a field.
- **Simple extension**: $L/K$ is simple if $L=K(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha\in L$. We have $$[K(\alpha):K]=\begin{cases}\deg\mu_{\alpha/K},&\text{if }\alpha\text{ is algebraic}\\\infty,&\text{if }\alpha\text{ is transcendental}\end{cases}$$by considering the set $\alpha^n,n\in\mathbb N$. The proof is detailed below. 
	- **Algebraic simple extension**: given $L/K$ and $\alpha\in L$ we have $$K(\alpha)/K\text{ is algebraic/finite}\iff\alpha \text{ is algebraic over }K\iff K[\alpha]=K(\alpha)$$**Proof**: we loop along $\Rightarrow$ to establish the equivalence. If $K(\alpha)/K$ is algebraic we have $\alpha$ algebraic over $K$ by definition; if $\alpha$ is algebraic, consider $\mu_{\alpha/K}$ ([[Polynomial over a Field]]), then for any $f\in K[x]$ we first use the Euclidean division ([[Polynomial Ring]]) to reduce to the case $\deg f<\deg\mu_{\alpha/K}$, and then use Bézout's identity ([[Polynomial]]) to get $$pf+q\mu_{\alpha/K}=1\quad\Longrightarrow\quad p(\alpha)f(\alpha)=1$$hence $(f(\alpha))^{-1}\in K[\alpha]$, which implies $K[\alpha]=K(\alpha)$; Finally to show $\dim_KK(\alpha)<\infty$ just notice that $\set{1,\alpha,\cdots,\alpha^{d-1}},d=\deg\mu_{\alpha/K}$ forms a $K$-basis for $K(\alpha)=K[\alpha]$.  
	- **Induction trick**: by definition given $L/K$ and $\alpha,\beta\in L$ we have $$K(\alpha,\beta)=K(\alpha)(\beta)$$Hence induction can be used when proving results for finitely generated field. This is immediately applicable to the next result for $\Leftarrow$.
- **Criterion for finite extension**: $L/K$ is finite iff it's algebraic with $L=K(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s)$. 
  **Proof**: given $L/K$ finite, if $\alpha\in L$ is not algebraic over $K$ then $\set{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\cdots}$ forms an infinite basis, which is a contradiction, and for the expression it suffices to take $\alpha_i$ the $K$-basis for $L$; conversely it suffices to use induction on $s$, based on the result on simple extension above.
	- Notice that finite $\Rightarrow$ algebraic, but the converse is not true in general.
## Algebra over a field
Given field $K$, a $K$-algebra is a [[Ring]] $A$ that is also a [[Vector Space]] over $K$, with compatibility of scalar multiplications: $(ax)\cdot(by)=(ab)(x\cdot y),\forall a,b\in K,x,y\in A$.
- **Normed algebra**: a normed algebra $V$ is a normed [[Vector Space]] that is also an algebra over $\mathbb R$ satisfying the sub-multiplicative property: $\|vw\|\le\|v\|\cdot\|w\|$ .
	- **Distributivity over convergent sequence**: given $\sum x_n=x,y\in V$ we have that $$yx-\sum_{n=1}^Nyx_n=y\sum_{n\in\mathbb N}x_n-y\sum_{n=1}^Nx_n=y\sum_{n=N+1}^\infty x_n$$by definition RHS converges to $0$, which proves the distributivity. 
- **Tensor product**: for two $K$-algebras $A,B$, the tensor product $A\otimes_K B$ is a $K$-algebra with $$(a_1\otimes b_1)(a_2\otimes b_2)=a_1a_2\otimes b_1b_2$$and other naturally induced operations.
- **Quotient algebra**: an algebra $A$ over commutative [[Ring]] $R$ is a ring itself, and given $I$ an ideal of $A$ closed under $R$-multiplication, $A/I$ inherits the structure of an algebra over $R$ and is called the quotient algebra.
- **Graded algebra**: an algebra $A$ over $K$ is **graded** if $A=\bigoplus A_k$ where $A_k$ are algebras such that $A_k\times A_l=A_{k+l}$. 
	- **Example**: a simple example is $\mathbb R[X_1,X_2]$ with $A_k$ being the set of all homogeneous polynomials of degree $k$. [[Polynomial Ring]]
