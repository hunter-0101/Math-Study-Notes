In this section we investigate the properties of polynomial $f\in K[X]$ given some [[Field]] $K$. More about the general algebraic structure of polynomials can be found in [[Polynomial Ring]]. Note that given homomorphism $\phi:K\to K'$ for any $f\in K[X]$ we denote $\phi(f)=f^\phi$. 
- **Split**: $f\in K[X]$ is said to splits over $K$ if there exists $k,k_1\cdots,k_{\deg f}$ s.t. $$f(X)=k\prod_{i=1}^{\deg f}(X-k_i)$$This means that all zeros of $f$ in $K$ are exactly $k_i$.
- **Formal derivative**: for $f\in K[X]$ define the derivative as $$f(X)=\sum_{i=0}^na_iX^i\quad\Longrightarrow\quad f'(X)=\sum_{i=1}^nia_iX^{i-1}$$This mimics the definition of [[Differential Calculus on Euclidean Space]].
	- **Arithmetic properties**: the usual properties of differentiation applies here, for instance, $$(f+g)'=f'+g',\quad(fg)'=f'g+fg'$$which can all be verified directly from definition, and by induction we have that $$\left(\prod_{i=1}^nf_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^nf_1\cdots f_{i-1}f_i'f_{i+1}\cdots f_n=\left(\prod_{i=1}^nf_i\right)\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{f_i'}{f_i}$$These formulas are quite useful for many problems. 
	- **Separability criterion**: an irreducible polynomial $f\in\irr K[X]$ is said to be separable if all its roots in the splitting field (defined below) are distinct. we have the equivalence $$f\text{ is separable}\quad\iff\quad \gcd(f,f')=1$$**Proof**: let $\sigma_1,\cdots,\sigma_s$ be all the distinct roots of $f$ on $\Sigma_{f/K}$, and write $$f(X)=\prod_{i=1}^s(X-\sigma_i)^{d_i},\quad d_i\in\mathbb Z_{\ge1}$$Then by direct verification we have that $(X-\sigma_i)^{d_i-1}\mid\gcd(f,f')$, therefore $$\gcd(f,f')=1\quad\iff\quad d_i=1,\quad\forall 1\le i\le s\quad\iff\quad f\text{ is separable}$$which completes the proof. 
## Splitting field
The **splitting field** of $f\in K[X]$ is an extension field $\Sigma/K$ ([[Field Extension]]) defined as $$\Sigma_{f/K}=\bigcap_{\Sigma'/K,f\text{ splits over }\Sigma'}\Sigma'$$i.e., it's the smallest extension of $K$ over which $f$ splits. The splitting field can actually be **uniquely (up to isomorphism)** constructed explicitly as $$\Sigma_{f/K}=K(\sigma_1,\cdots,\sigma_{\deg f})\where\sigma_i,1\le i\le\deg f\text{ are all roots of }f$$**Proof**: for existence it suffices to find one root of $f$, generated an extension field, and apply induction. Take $f\in K[X]$ and pick $g\mid f,g\in\irr K[X]$. Consider the quotient ([[Ideal]]) $$\pi:K[X]\to L=K[X]/(g(X)),\quad \pi:h\mapsto h\bmod g$$Since $(g(X))$ is a maximal [[Ideal]] by irreducibility ([[Integral Domain]]), $L$ is a field, and we can treat $L$ as an extension of $K$ because $\pi|_K$ is injective. Let $\alpha=\pi(X)$, then by preservation of operations of [[Ring]] homomorphism we have $$f(\alpha)=f(\pi(X))=\pi(f(X))=f\bmod g=0$$Therefore $\alpha$ is a root of $f$, and by [[Field Extension]] we have that $[L:K]\le\deg f=n$. By induction we can iteratively construct the extension field over which $f$ splits as $$\Sigma_{f/K}=K(\sigma_1,\cdots,\sigma_{\deg f})\quad\text{with}\quad[\Sigma_{f/K}:K]\le n!$$For uniqueness up to isomorphism, assume that there are two splitting fields $\Sigma,\Sigma'$. Pick a root $\sigma$ of $f$ in $\Sigma$, then since $\mu_{\sigma/K}\mid f$ also splits over $\Sigma'$ we can pick its root $\sigma'\in\Sigma'$, with $\mu_{\sigma'/K}=\mu_{\sigma/K}$ by irreducibility. Now by the result on isomorphic simple [[Field Extension]] applied on $\id:K\to K$, there exists an isomorphism $$\psi:K(\sigma)\to K(\sigma')\quad\st\quad\psi|_K=\id,\quad\psi(\sigma)=\sigma'$$By repeating this process iteratively on $f/(X-\sigma)$ we completes the proof.
- **Intuition of the construction**: the key idea is that, instead of trying to find a root of $f$ one outside $K$ we create one directly from $K[X]$ itself. More specifically, by taking quotient w.r.t $(g(X))$ we are in effect enforcing $g(X)\equiv 0$ in the extension field $$K\hookrightarrow K[X]/(g(X))$$Therefore $f$, being a multiple of $g$, also vanishes evaluated at the image of $X$. 
- **Uniqueness of splitting field under isomorphic field**: given isomorphism $\phi:K\to K'$ and $f\in K[X]$, denote the splitting fields of $f,f^\phi$ as $\Sigma,\Sigma'$, then there exists an isomorphism $\psi:\Sigma\to\Sigma'$ s.t. $\psi|_K=\phi$, i.e.,

  **Proof**: we construct $\psi$ by induction on $\deg f$. Let $\sigma\in\Sigma$ be a root of $f$, then by invariance of division relation we have $\mu^\phi_{\sigma/K}$ irreducible over $K'$. Meanwhile, since $\mu^\phi_{\sigma/K}\mid f^\phi$ which splits over $L$, we pick $\sigma'\in\Sigma'$ a root of $\mu^\phi_{\sigma/K}$, then irreducibility implies $$\mu_{\sigma/K}^\phi=\mu_{\sigma'/K'}$$Now by isomorphic simple extension above there exists $\psi_1$ that with the desired properties. Now the induction assumption applied on $f/(X-\sigma)$ completes the proof. 
	- **Discussion**: the uniqueness part above is actually a corollary of this result applied on $\id:K\to K$.
