A **[[Field]] extension** is an inclusion map $$\iota:K\to L$$which will be denoted $L/K$, with $L$ being the **extension field** and $K$ being the **subfield**. When there is a chain $L/M/K$ we call $M$ the **intermediate field**. Note that we sometimes allows an extension to only contain an isomorphic copy of the subfield rather than containing it. 
- **Degree**: by viewing $L$ as a $K$-[[Vector Space]], the degree of $L/K$ is defined as $$[L:K]=\dim_KL$$An extension of finite degree is called a **finite extension**.
	- **Short tower law**: given $K\subset M\subset L$ we have $$[L:K]=[L:M][M:K]$$**Proof**: take $B_{L/M}=\set{l_i},B_{M/K}=\set{m_j}$ the basis s.t. $$L=\span_M(B_{L/M}),\quad M=\span_K(B_{M/K})$$then obviously $B=B_{L/M}B_{M/K}$ forms a $K$-frame for $L$. For linear dependence notice that $$\sum_{i,j}k_{ij}l_jm_j=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sum_j\left(\sum_i k_{ij}l_j\right)m_i=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sum_ik_{ij}l_j=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad k_{ij}=0,\forall i,j$$hence $B$ is indeed a $K$-basis for $L$, completing the proof.
	- **Tower law**: by induction we can easily show that $$[K_n:K_0]=\prod_{i=1}^n[K_i:K_{i-1}]$$This is quite useful for determining the degree of an extension. 
- **Algebraic extension**: $L/K$ is algebraic if any $\alpha\in L$ is algebraic over $K$. 
	- **Finite $\implies$ Algebraic**: a finite extension must be algebraic, since otherwise any transcendental element $\alpha\in L$ would generate an infinite linearly-independent set $\set{\alpha^n:n\in\mathbb N}$, making the extension infinite. Note that the converse is not true in general. 
	- **Examples of infinite algebraic extension** 
		- **Roots of unity**: consider $$\mathbb Q(U)/\mathbb Q\quad\text{where}\quad U=\set{z\in\mathbb C:z^p=1,p\in\mathbb P}$$This is infinite because any set of $p$-th roots of unity contributes $p-1$ degrees, and is algebraic due to some simple identities.
		- **Square root of primes**: consider $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{\mathbb P})/\mathbb Q\quad\text{where}\quad\sqrt{\mathbb P}=\set{\sqrt p:p\in\mathbb P}$$This is infinite because elements in $\sqrt{\mathbb P}$ are $\mathbb Q$-linearly independent. 
## Extension by field generation
The **field generated by $S$ over $K$** is defined as $$K(S)=\bigcap_{S\subset M,L/M/K}M$$which exists and is unique given any $S\subset L$ since the set of intermediate fields is closed under intersection. When $|S|<\infty$ we say it's **finitely generated**. 
- **Characterization of finitely generated field**: it's trivial that $$K(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s)=\Frac K[\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s]$$where $K[\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s]$ is the multivariate [[Polynomial Ring]], since all elements in RHS can be obtained via algebraic calculation, while it's indeed a field ([[Integral Domain]]).
- **Simple extension**: $L/K$ is simple if $L=K(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha\in L$. We have $$[K(\alpha):K]=\begin{cases}\deg\mu_{\alpha/K},&\text{if }\alpha\text{ is algebraic over }K\\\infty,&\text{if }\alpha\text{ is transcendental}\end{cases}$$by considering the set $\alpha^n,n\in\mathbb N$. The proof is detailed below. 
	- **Algebraic simple extension**: given $L/K$ and $\alpha\in L$ we have $$\begin{align}&K(\alpha)/K\text{ is algebraic}\quad\iff\quad K(\alpha)/K\text{ is finite}\\&\iff\quad\alpha \text{ is algebraic over }K\quad\iff\quad K[\alpha]=K(\alpha)\end{align}$$**Proof**: we loop along $\Rightarrow$ to establish the equivalence. If $K(\alpha)/K$ is algebraic we have $\alpha$ algebraic over $K$ by definition; if $\alpha$ is algebraic, consider $\mu_{\alpha/K}$ ([[Polynomial over a Field]]), then for any $f\in K[x]$ we first use the Euclidean division ([[Polynomial Ring]]) to reduce to the case $\deg f<\deg\mu_{\alpha/K}$, and then use Bézout's identity ([[Polynomial]]) to get $$pf+q\mu_{\alpha/K}=1\quad\Longrightarrow\quad p(\alpha)f(\alpha)=1$$hence $(f(\alpha))^{-1}\in K[\alpha]$, which implies $K[\alpha]=K(\alpha)$; Finally to show $\dim_KK(\alpha)<\infty$ just notice that $\set{1,\alpha,\cdots,\alpha^{d-1}},d=\deg\mu_{\alpha/K}$ forms a $K$-basis for $K(\alpha)=K[\alpha]$.  
	- **Induction trick**: by definition given $L/K$ and $\alpha,\beta\in L$ we have $$K(\alpha,\beta)=K(\alpha)(\beta)$$Hence induction can be used when proving results for finitely generated field. This is immediately applicable to the next result for $\Leftarrow$.
- **Criterion for finite extension**: $L/K$ is finite iff it's algebraic with $L=K(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s)$. 
  **Proof**: given $L/K$ finite, if $\alpha\in L$ is not algebraic over $K$ then $\set{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\cdots}$ forms an infinite basis, which is a contradiction, and for the expression it suffices to take $\alpha_i$ the $K$-basis for $L$; conversely it suffices to use induction on $s$, based on the result on simple extension above.
- **Composition of algebraic extension**: $L/M,M/K$ both algebraic implies $L/K$ algebraic.
  **Proof**: for any $\alpha\in L$, since $L/M$ is algebraic there exist $b_i\in M$ s.t. $\sum_{i=0}^nb_i\alpha^i=0$, hence $$\begin{align}[K(\alpha):K]&\le[K(b_0,\cdots,b_n,\alpha):K]\\&=[K(b_0,\cdots,b_n,\alpha):K(b_0,\cdots,b_n)][K(b_0,\cdots,b_n):K]\\&<\infty\end{align}$$Where we used the tower law above and the finite extension criterion below, hence $\alpha$ is algebraic over $K$. By arbitrariness $L/K$ is algebraic.
## Minimal polynomial
Given algebraic $\alpha\in L$ ([[Field]]) in an extension $L/K$, by PID structure of [[Polynomial Ring]] there exists a the unique **monic polynomial of least degree** s.t. $$\mu_{\alpha/K}(\alpha)=0\where \mu_{\alpha/K}\in K[X]$$which is called these **minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $K$**. 
- **Quotient by ideal of minimal polynomial**: we have the isomorphism $$\phi:K(\alpha)\to K[X]/(\mu_{\alpha/K}(X)),\quad\alpha\mapsto\overline X$$**Proof**: consider the map $$\varphi:K[X]\to L,\quad f(X)\mapsto f(\alpha)\imply\ker\varphi=(\mu_{\alpha/K}(X))$$Hence the desired $\phi$ follows from the fundamental homomorphism theorem ([[Ring]]). 
	- **Intuition**: given $\alpha$ algebraic it's quite trivial by definition that we have $$K(\alpha)=\span_K\left(\alpha^i:0\le i\le\deg\mu_{\alpha/K}-1\right)$$This basis is realized algebraically by taking quotient w.r.t the ideal $(\mu_{\alpha/K})$. 
	- **Example**: it's quite trivial that we have the isomorphism $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt 2)\cong\mathbb Q[X]/(X^2-1),\quad\sqrt 2\leftrightarrow X\bmod (X^2-1)$$Another illustrative example is the isomorphism $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt[3]2)\cong\mathbb Q[X]/(X^3-1),\quad\sqrt[3]{2}\leftrightarrow X\bmod(X^3-1)$$All of these concretize the intuition of linearly independent set above. 
- **Isomorphic simple extension**: given isomorphism $\phi:K\to K'$, which induces $$\phi:K[X]\to K'[X],\quad f(X)=\sum_{i=0}^n a_iX^i\mapsto f^\phi(X)=\sum_{i=0}^n\phi(a_i)X^i$$If $g\in K[X]$ is irreducible, then for any root $\alpha,\alpha'$ of $g,g^\phi$ there exists a isomorphism $$\psi:K(\alpha)\to K'(\alpha')\quad\st\quad\psi|_K=\phi,\psi(\alpha)=\alpha'$$**Proof**: $\phi:K[X]\to K'[X]$ is obviously an isomorphism, by preservation of division relation under isomorphism ([[Field]]) we have $g^\phi$ also irreducible, therefore the result above we have $$K(\alpha)\cong K[X]/(g(X)),\quad K'(\alpha')\cong K'[X]/(g^\phi(X))$$hence by suitable composition we get the desired isomorphism. 
	- **Intuition**: the key is that irreducibility is preserved under isomorphism, hence any two roots above have the corresponding minimal polynomial. This also illustrates the fact that it's impossible to distinguish between two different roots of the same polynomial without extra structural information. 
## Normal extension
An extension $L/K$ is **normal** if every irreducible ([[Integral Domain]]) $f\in K[X]$ that has zero in $L$ splits ([[Polynomial over a Field]]) over $L$. 
- **Normality criterion**: assuming that $[L:K]<\infty$, the following three are equivalent: 
	1. $L/K$ is normal.
	2. $L$ is the splitting field of some $f\in K[X]$. 
	3. Any $K$-homomorphism $\phi:L\to L'$, where $L'$ is any extension of $L$, is an automorphism of $L$.
  **Proof**: for $1\Rightarrow2$, by finiteness criterion ([[Field]]) we have $L=K(\ell_1,\cdots,\ell_s)$ with $\ell_i,\forall 1\le i\le s$ algebraic over $K$. Consider $$f=\prod_{i=1}^s\mu_{\ell_i/K}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad f(\ell_i)=0,\forall 1\le i\le s\quad\Longrightarrow\quad L\text{ is the splitting field of }f$$For $2\Rightarrow3$, for $L=K(\ell_1,\cdots,\ell_s)$ for $f\in K[X]$ having roots $\ell_i$, any $K$-homomorphism $\phi$ fixes the coefficients of $g\in K[X]$, hence permuting its roots, therefore $\phi(L)=L$. For $3\Rightarrow1$, take any irreducible $f\in K[X]$ that has a root $\alpha\in L$, and denote $L'$ its splitting field over $L$. Pick another root $\beta$, then by definition $\beta\in L'$. By isomorphic simple extension above there exists $$\psi:K(\alpha)\to K(\beta)\quad\text{s.t.}\quad\psi|_K=\id_K,\quad\psi(\alpha)=\beta$$By uniqueness of splitting field $\psi$ extends to $\tau:L\to L'$. By hypothesis, $\beta=\tau|_L(\alpha)\in L$. 
- **Normal closure**: a normal closure of finite $L/K$ is an extension $N/L$ s.t. 
  1. $N/K$ is normal, 
  2. $L\subset M\subset N$ with $N/K$ normal implies $M=N$.
	- **Existence & Uniqueness within $\mathbb C$**: if $L/K$ is a finite extension in $\mathbb C$, then normal closure $N\subset\mathbb C$ exists and is unique and finite.
	  **Proof**: by finiteness we can assume $L=K(\ell_1,\cdots,\ell_s)$ ([[Field]]), and consider $$f=\prod_{i=1}^s\mu_{\ell_i/K}$$Denote the splitting field of $f$ as $N\subset\mathbb C$, which is normal and finite by criterion above. Suppose $L\subset P\subset N$ with $P/K$ normal, then by normality $\ell_i\in P$ implies that $\mu_{\ell_i/K}$ splits over $P$, hence $f$ splits over $P$, and by minimality of splitting field we have $P=N$. For uniqueness, just invoke the definitions and minimality of splitting field.
## Separable extension
An irreducible element $f\in\irr K[X]$ is **separable** if all its roots in its splitting field are distinct, and an element $\alpha$ algebraic over $K$ is separable if $\mu_{\alpha/K}$ is separable. Moreover, an extension $L/K$ is separable if all elements in $L$ are separable over $K$. 
- **Primitive element theorem**: finite separable extension is simple.
  **Proof**: for $L/K$ finite and separable, if $K$ is finite, then so is $L$, and in this case $L^\times$ is cyclic ([[Field]]), hence $L/K$ is simple; if $K$ is infinite, by induction trick ([[Field]]) it suffices to show that $$L=K(\alpha,\beta)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad L=K(\theta)$$Denote the roots of $\mu_{\alpha/K}$ as $\alpha=\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_m$, and similarly for $\beta=\beta_1,\cdots,\beta_n$, which are distinct by assumption. Since $K$ is infinite, we can find $c\in K$ s.t. $$c\neq\frac{\alpha_i-\alpha_j}{\beta_s-\beta_t},\quad\forall 1\le i,j\le m,1\le s,t\le n,s\neq t$$Consider $$\theta=\alpha+c\beta,\quad h(X)=\mu_{\alpha/K}(\theta-cX)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad h(X)\in K(\theta)[X],\quad h(\beta)=0$$while $h(\beta_j)\neq0,\forall j\ge2$. It follows that $$\gcd_{K(\theta)[X]}(\mu_{\beta/K}(X),h(X))=X-\beta$$Consequently, $\beta\in K(\theta)$, and further $\alpha\in K(\theta)$, thus $K(\theta)=K(\alpha,\beta)=L$.
