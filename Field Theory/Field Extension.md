A **[[Field]] extension** is an inclusion map $$\iota:K\to L$$which will be denoted $L/K$, with $L$ being the **extension field** and $K$ being the **subfield**. When there is a chain $L/M/K$ we call $M$ the **intermediate field**. 
- **Degree**: by viewing $L$ as a $K$-[[Vector Space]], the degree of $L/K$ is defined as $$[L:K]=\dim_KL$$An extension of finite degree is called a **finite extension**.
	- **Short tower law**: given $K\subset M\subset L$ we have $$[L:K]=[L:M][M:K]$$**Proof**: take $B_{L/M}=\set{l_i},B_{M/K}=\set{m_j}$ the basis s.t. $$L=\span_M(B_{L/M}),\quad M=\span_K(B_{M/K})$$then obviously $B=B_{L/M}B_{M/K}$ forms a $K$-frame for $L$. For linear dependence notice that $$\sum_{i,j}k_{ij}l_jm_j=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sum_j\left(\sum_i k_{ij}l_j\right)m_i=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\sum_ik_{ij}l_j=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad k_{ij}=0,\forall i,j$$hence $B$ is indeed a $K$-basis for $L$, completing the proof.
	- **Tower law**: by induction we can easily show that $$[K_n:K_0]=\prod_{i=1}^n[K_i:K_{i-1}]$$This is quite useful for determining the degree of an extension. 
- **Algebraic extension**: $L/K$ is algebraic if any $\alpha\in L$ is algebraic over $K$. 
	- **Finite $\implies$ Algebraic**: a finite extension must be algebraic, since otherwise any transcendental element $\alpha\in L$ would generate an infinite linearly-independent set $\set{\alpha^n:n\in\mathbb N}$, making the extension infinite. Note that the converse is not true in general. 
	- **Examples of infinite algebraic extension** 
		- **Roots of unity**: consider $$\mathbb Q(U)/\mathbb Q\quad\text{where}\quad U=\set{z\in\mathbb C:z^p=1,p\in\mathbb P}$$This is infinite because any set of $p$-th roots of unity contributes $p-1$ degrees, and is algebraic due to some simple identities.
		- **Square root of primes**: consider $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{\mathbb P})/\mathbb Q\quad\text{where}\quad\sqrt{\mathbb P}=\set{\sqrt p:p\in\mathbb P}$$This is infinite because elements in $\sqrt{\mathbb P}$ are $\mathbb Q$-linearly independent. 
## Extension by field generation
The **field generated by $S$ over $K$** is defined as $$K(S)=\bigcap_{S\subset M,L/M/K}M$$which exists and is unique given any $S\subset L$ since the set of intermediate fields is closed under intersection. When $|S|<\infty$ we say it's **finitely generated**. 
- **Characterization of finitely generated field**: it's trivial that $$K(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s)=\Frac K[\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s]$$where $K[\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s]$ is the multivariate [[Polynomial Ring]], since all elements in RHS can be obtained via algebraic calculation, while it's indeed a field ([[Integral Domain]]).
- **Simple extension**: $L/K$ is simple if $L=K(\alpha)$ for some $\alpha\in L$. We have $$[K(\alpha):K]=\begin{cases}\deg\mu_{\alpha/K},&\text{if }\alpha\text{ is algebraic over }K\\\infty,&\text{if }\alpha\text{ is transcendental}\end{cases}$$by considering the set $\alpha^n,n\in\mathbb N$. The proof is detailed below. 
	- **Algebraic simple extension**: given $L/K$ and $\alpha\in L$ we have $$\begin{align}&K(\alpha)/K\text{ is algebraic}\quad\iff\quad K(\alpha)/K\text{ is finite}\\&\iff\quad\alpha \text{ is algebraic over }K\quad\iff\quad K[\alpha]=K(\alpha)\end{align}$$**Proof**: we loop along $\Rightarrow$ to establish the equivalence. If $K(\alpha)/K$ is algebraic we have $\alpha$ algebraic over $K$ by definition; if $\alpha$ is algebraic, consider $\mu_{\alpha/K}$ ([[Polynomial over a Field]]), then for any $f\in K[x]$ we first use the Euclidean division ([[Polynomial Ring]]) to reduce to the case $\deg f<\deg\mu_{\alpha/K}$, and then use Bézout's identity ([[Polynomial]]) to get $$pf+q\mu_{\alpha/K}=1\quad\Longrightarrow\quad p(\alpha)f(\alpha)=1$$hence $(f(\alpha))^{-1}\in K[\alpha]$, which implies $K[\alpha]=K(\alpha)$; Finally to show $\dim_KK(\alpha)<\infty$ just notice that $\set{1,\alpha,\cdots,\alpha^{d-1}},d=\deg\mu_{\alpha/K}$ forms a $K$-basis for $K(\alpha)=K[\alpha]$.  
	- **Induction trick**: by definition given $L/K$ and $\alpha,\beta\in L$ we have $$K(\alpha,\beta)=K(\alpha)(\beta)$$Hence induction can be used when proving results for finitely generated field. This is immediately applicable to the next result for $\Leftarrow$.
- **Criterion for finite extension**: $L/K$ is finite iff it's algebraic with $L=K(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_s)$. 
  **Proof**: given $L/K$ finite, if $\alpha\in L$ is not algebraic over $K$ then $\set{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\cdots}$ forms an infinite basis, which is a contradiction, and for the expression it suffices to take $\alpha_i$ the $K$-basis for $L$; conversely it suffices to use induction on $s$, based on the result on simple extension above.
- **Composition of algebraic extension**: $L/M,M/K$ both algebraic implies $L/K$ algebraic.
  **Proof**: for any $\alpha\in L$, since $L/M$ is algebraic there exist $b_i\in M$ s.t. $\sum_{i=0}^nb_i\alpha^i=0$, hence $$\begin{align}[K(\alpha):K]&\le[K(b_0,\cdots,b_n,\alpha):K]\\&=[K(b_0,\cdots,b_n,\alpha):K(b_0,\cdots,b_n)][K(b_0,\cdots,b_n):K]\\&<\infty\end{align}$$Where we used the tower law above and the finite extension criterion below, hence $\alpha$ is algebraic over $K$. By arbitrariness $L/K$ is algebraic.
## Minimal polynomial
Given algebraic $\alpha\in L$ ([[Field]]) in an extension $L/K$, by PID structure of [[Polynomial Ring]] there exists a the unique **monic polynomial of least degree** s.t. $$\mu_{\alpha/K}(\alpha)=0\where \mu_{\alpha/K}\in K[X]$$which is called the **minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $K$**. 
- **Quotient by ideal of minimal polynomial**: we have the isomorphism $$\phi:K(\alpha)\to K[X]/(\mu_{\alpha/K}(X)),\quad\alpha\mapsto\overline X$$**Proof**: consider the map $$\varphi:K[X]\to L,\quad f(X)\mapsto f(\alpha)\imply\ker\varphi=(\mu_{\alpha/K}(X))$$Hence the desired $\phi$ follows from the fundamental homomorphism theorem ([[Ring]]). 
- **Isomorphic simple extension**: given isomorphism $\phi:K\to K'$, which induces $$\phi:K[X]\to K'[X],\quad f(X)=\sum_{i=0}^n a_iX^i\mapsto f^\phi(X)=\sum_{i=0}^n\phi(a_i)X^i$$If $g\in K[X]$ is irreducible, then for any root $\alpha,\alpha'$ of $g,g^\phi$ there exists $\psi:K(\alpha)\to K'(\alpha')$ s.t. $\psi|_K=\phi,\psi(\alpha)=\alpha'$.
  **Proof**: $\phi:K[X]\to K'[X]$ is obviously an isomorphism, and the last result we also have $$K(\alpha)\cong K[X]/(g(X)),\quad K'(\alpha')\cong K'[X]/(g^\phi(X))$$hence by proper composition we get the desired isomorphism.
